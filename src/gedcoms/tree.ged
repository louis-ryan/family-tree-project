1 CONC Murray Wilcox: "One of the poets of Australian law"
1 CONT
1 CONT Murray Rutledge Wilcox, AO QC, was a judge on the federal court, where he 
1 CONC was known as a progressive, incisive and courageous figure. He was a 
1 CONC committed conservationist, instrumental in stopping the damming of the 
1 CONC Franklin River in the 1980s and, upon his retirement, was described as 
1 CONC "one of the poets of Australian law".
1 CONT
1 CONT Murray was born in 1937 in Longueville, to Valerie and Donald Wilcox. His 
1 CONC father was a Presbyterian minister and moved between parishes, with 
1 CONC Murray growing up in Lane Cove, Braidwood, Guildford, Hornsby, 
1 CONC Tumbarumba, Mudgee, and Haberfield. He completed his education at Scots 
1 CONC College, where he was a good student who excelled in debating.
1 CONT
1 CONT It was during his time at Scots that Murray decided to become a lawyer, 
1 CONC after a grim incident in the life of the school. A student's father was 
1 CONC charged with murdering his mother by lacing Minties with strychnine. 
1 CONC Murray remembered the entire school was fascinated by the horrible case, 
1 CONC and he read daily reports of the court case in the Sydney Morning Herald, 
1 CONC deciding at that moment to become a barrister.
1 CONT
1 CONT Murray started his law studies at Sydney University in 1954, and was 
1 CONC articled to the firm Sly and Russell.
1 CONT
1 CONT Towards the end of his first year of university, Murray met Christina 
1 CONC Gaven, on a day he would later describe as the most important of his 
1 CONC life. He was enchanted by her and would spend the rest of his life  
1 CONC adoring her. They married in 1959.
1 CONT
1 CONT Upon graduation, he moved to Cooma, which, due to the Snowy Mountains 
1 CONC Scheme, was buzzing with litigation opportunities. Wilcox, a newly 
1 CONC admitted, 22-year-old solicitor, was left to deal with whatever case 
1 CONC walked through the door, with little assistance, and rose to the 
1 CONC challenge.
1 CONT
1 CONT While in Cooma, the first of Murray and Chris' three children, Gavin, was 
1 CONC born. They returned to Sydney in 1963 for Murray to go the bar and in the 
1 CONC years following, Murray and Chris had two daughters, Felicity and Anne.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1976 he became a member of the Law Reform Commission, of which he was 
1 CONC chairman from 1984-85. In 1977, he was made senior counsel and in 1984, 
1 CONC appointed as a judge of the Federal Court. During his 22 years on the 
1 CONC bench he was known for his profound empathy and ability to get to the 
1 CONC heart of the issue. He was a humble man, with a seemingly endless 
1 CONC capacity to listen to other points of view.
1 CONT
1 CONT Some of his most significant cases included being on the bench that 
1 CONC granted an injunction preventing the termination of the Maritime Union of 
1 CONC Australia in 1998, a key moment in Australian industrial relations 
1 CONC history and the Noongar native title case, which he delivered just two 
1 CONC weeks before retiring in 2006. In this case he granted native title to 
1 CONC the Noongar people for an area in West Australia that included Perth. The 
1 CONC decision was overturned on appeal, but reflected his willingness to take 
1 CONC courageous decisions, even if they were not politic.
1 CONT
1 CONT Wilcox saw the law as a means of protecting the vulnerable and 
1 CONC marginalised, and was particularly passionate about Indigenous land 
1 CONC rights, anti-discrimination legislation and fighting for the protection 
1 CONC of the environment.
1 CONT He was appointed as chief justice of the Industrial Relations Court of 
1 CONC Australia, a role he held from 1994 until his retirement in 2006. When 
1 CONC the attorney-general offered him the position, Wilcox reminded him he had 
1 CONC publicly opposed the creation of the court. Wilcox was told it was 
1 CONC precisely for this reason he had been chosen, as he more than anyone 
1 CONC would know and avoid the pitfalls of the court.
1 CONT
1 CONT He wrote three books about law in Australia and upon retirement Michael 
1 CONC Slattery, QC, now a Supreme Court judge, said he "justly retires as one 
1 CONC of the poets of Australian Law".
1 CONT
1 CONT In 2010, he was made an officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for his 
1 CONC service as a judge and his environmental work, which was the other great 
1 CONC strand of Wilcox's professional life.
1 CONT
1 CONT As a barrister he represented conservation groups in several important 
1 CONC cases, including the Myall Lakes inquiry against sand-mining and was the 
1 CONC foundation president of the Environmental Law Association of NSW.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1979, Wilcox was elected president of the Australian Conservation 
1 CONC Foundation and was instrumental in the fight to prevent the Franklin 
1 CONC river being dammed. He lobbied ministers on both sides of politics and 
1 CONC united conservation groups in the effort to make the Franklin a defining 
1 CONC issue of the 1983 federal election.
1 CONT
1 CONT Late on election night in 1983, when the news came through that Labor had 
1 CONC won, thereby ensuring the Franklin would be saved, Wilcox, jubilant, ran 
1 CONC to the family swimming pool and dived in, fully-clothed.
1 CONT
1 CONT His environmentalism was not abstemious, rather he gloried in the beauty 
1 CONC of nature and wanted to preserve it so it could be enjoyed. He loved 
1 CONC bushwalking and with Chris walked the South Coast track in Tasmania three 
1 CONC times, climbed Table Mountain in Cape Town, walked the foothills of the 
1 CONC Annapurna mountains, climbed Kinabalu in Borneo, and Mount Kilimanjaro in 
1 CONC Tanzania, a trek that almost killed him after he contracted severe 
1 CONC altitude sickness.
1 CONT
1 CONT On one family holiday to Lord Howe Island, he took his son Gavin, then 
1 CONC about 12, on a hike up Mount Gower. The next day his daughter Felicity 
1 CONC was supposed to do the walk with Chris, but Chris woke up feeling ill. 
1 CONC Murray turned around and did the 10-hour walk for a second-day running so 
1 CONC Felicity wouldn't miss out.
1 CONT
1 CONT Murray enjoyed so much in life: good food, music, theatre, political 
1 CONC debate, literature and watching cricket and tennis. He and Chris drew 
1 CONC around themselves an enoThough he was highly esteemed in his professional 
1 CONC life, he was treated with far less deference by his family. His children, 
1 CONC as teenagers, invented the verb "to swabb" (speaking with authority but 
1 CONC bull) to describe Murray's actions on the rare occasions he did not know 
1 CONC something about a topic, but spoke with the authority of one who did.
1 CONT
1 CONT Murray also received mockery for his complicated Easter egg hunts, for 
1 CONC which he wrote clues so cryptic, requiring detailed knowledge of Latin, 
1 CONC botany, and Shakespeare, that participants would regularly end up 
1 CONC muttering bitterly about his clues and would seek out ways of cheating.
1 CONT
1 CONT The great heartbreak of his life came in 2008 when he lost his son Gavin 
1 CONC to cancer, aged 46. It was a grave loss to the family and one that meant 
1 CONC Murray's last decade, though rich and joyful, was shadowed with sadness.
1 CONT
1 CONT Murray Rutledge Wilcox died from a heart attack on November 8, aged 81, 
1 CONC while on a boat trip on the Murray River with Chris and friends 
1 CONC celebrating their 59th wedding anniversary. Right up until he died, he 
1 CONC had been doing what he loved best - enjoying nature, talking to 
1 CONC interesting people and enjoying good food and wine.
1 CONT He is survived by his wife Christina, his daughters Felicity and Anne, 
1 CONC daughter-in-law Wendy, son-in-law David, seven grandchildren and one 
1 CONC great-grandson.

1 CONC In 1896 Arthur was sent by his father to Paris to join the firm of 
1 CONC Debenham & Freebody to learn the lace trade, where he remained for four 
1 CONC years. His father had already founded the firm of Crawshaw and Company, 
1 CONC textile importers and merchants.   The firm was named after Edward's 
1 CONC early benefactor who sponsored his migration to NSW.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1900 Arthur returned to Sydney to manage Crawshaw and Company. Their 
1 CONC address at time was 416 George Street, Sydney. At that time Edward was 
1 CONC the London buyer.
1 CONT
1 CONT Crawshaw & Co became a public company in 1919 and in 1924 Arthur was sent 
1 CONC to London as the London Buyer, returning in 1928 because of the economic 
1 CONC conditions.  In London the family lived at 26 Shepherds Hill Road, 
1 CONC Highgate. (The home was still intact as flats in March 1998). The company 
1 CONC actually failed during The Depression.  In 1931 Arthur restarted the firm 
1 CONC as Crawshaw Wilcox & Son, passed the management to his son Ken and upon 
1 CONC Ken's retirement it was sold intact to a competitor.  A full account of 
1 CONC the firm's history has been written by Ken Wilcox.
1 CONT
1 CONT Arthur's move to London meant that the whole family moved to London. They

1 CONC There is no record at the Family Records Centre in London of a birth 
1 CONC anywhere in England of an Edward Middleton Wilcox from June 1849 to March 
1 CONC 1854. If his death certificate is correct showing his age as 71 years on 
1 CONC 15 August 1921, he must have been born between 16 August 1849 and 15 
1 CONC August 1850.  I have to assume that Edward's birth certificate is the one 
1 CONC which shows his birth name as "Ernest Booth Wilcox" (mother Mary Ann 
1 CONC Wilcox and no father given).  A second birth at the same registry and 
1 CONC same parental details is shown for Arthur Booth Wilcox on 15 May 1851. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Three Edward's were born in England in this period, at Montgomery, in 
1 CONC book Sep 1850, ref XXVII page 111, at Holywell, in book Sep 1850, ref  
1 CONC XXVII page 253, and at Clifton, in book Mar 1852, ref 6a page 100.  None 
1 CONC of these could be our Edward as his mother could not have had an extra 
1 CONC child at these times. I did not request birth certificates.
1 CONT
1 CONT The marriage certificate of Edward and Lucy shows the name as Edward 
1 CONC Middleton Wilcox.  Edward's death certificate, issued at Hackney, Stoke 
1 CONC Newington, London, shows his name as Edward Middleton Wilcox and the 
1 CONC place of death as 56 Queens Road.  Walter Wilcox 's address (as 
1 CONC informant) is shown as 12 Arnold Avenue, Birkby, Huddersfield.
1 CONT
1 CONT Edward's parents were married some years after his birth, possibly even 
1 CONC after he migrated to NSW in 1867 at the age of 17.  He was sponsored by a 
1 CONC Mr Crawshaw. He joined David Jones Stores in 1867 and worked in Sydney 
1 CONC until he was transferred to London as the London Buyer in 1885.  A full 
1 CONC account of this is on file in his son Ernest's diary.
1 CONT
1 CONT From 1885 to 1892 the family lived at 65 Pyrland Road, North London. In 
1 CONC 1913 the home was at 29 Stanley Gardens, North London (near Finsbury 
1 CONC Park).  It was named "Burwood" after the suburb of their Sydney home.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT New information found by John Wilcox in Sep 2010
1 CONT
1 CONT In the 1851 census (30 March 1851) Ernest Booth, apprentice draper, age 
1 CONC 20 is at home with his parents James Booth age 45, Station Master 
1 CONC Nottingham and Millicent Booth. He is the eldest of 9 siblings, the 
1 CONC youngest is 6 months.
1 CONT
1 CONT Also in the 1851 census Lucy Wilcox (Mary�s mother) is shown as a widow 
1 CONC living with Daughter Anne 25 and son John Coupland 31). There is no sign 
1 CONC of Mary or Edward at that address.
1 CONT
1 CONT In the census of 1861 Edward is recorded as aged 11 (born in Grantham, 
1 CONC Lincolnshire) living as a a boarder with Henry Eccleston, railway clerk 
1 CONC aged 30, his wife Lydia 26, their two sons and one daughter. In the house 
1 CONC were 2 boarders and a visitor.  The family lived in Islington, London.

1 CONT Lucy and her children, Ernest, Arthur, Lucy, Hilda and Walter sailed from 
1 CONC Sydney to England aboard the frigate SS Parramatta in 1886.  They were 
1 CONC assisted by their helper "Aunty Pontey".  Edward had gone the previous

1 CONC After having two illegitimate children with Mary Anne, Ernest left 
1 CONC England as one of 377 passengers and crew on the "Eagle" which sailed 
1 CONC from Liverpool about January 1853.  The ship arrived in Melbourne in May 
1 CONC 1853.  It is not yet known why he went to Victoria but his death 
1 CONC certificate says he stayed there for four years.  His occupation as shown 
1 CONC on the ship's manifest is "Draper". He may have worked at this occupation 
1 CONC or he may have been enticed by the Victorian goldrush.
1 CONT
1 CONT He returned to England about 1857 and married Mary Anne in London in 1860 
1 CONC (see marriage notes). They left England soon after their marriage and 
1 CONC arrived in Melbourne on "Queen of Commerce" in March 1861. After a short 
1 CONC stay in Victoria (presumably with Ernest's family) they left for 
1 CONC Brisbane. James was born in Queensland in June 1861.
1 CONT
1 CONT Their daughter Victoria, who was probably named after the Colony, was 
1 CONC present at Ernest's death.  She was then 49 and still unmarried.  As she 
1 CONC was about 26 when her mother got cancer, it is most likely that she 
1 CONC looked after both parents.  She probably never married as there is no 
1 CONC record of a marriage in Queensland (at least until 1925). 
1 CONT
1 CONT There is no mention of the two illegitimate sons on either of their 
1 CONC parent's death certificates.  Edward may have been farmed out soon after 
1 CONC birth and Arthur may have died (see Arthur's notes) but in any case 
1 CONC reference to these two boys was avoided.
1 CONT
1 CONT It is not known how or why Edward's name was changed from Ernest Booth 
1 CONC Wilcox as it appears on his birth certificate. It is believed that he 
1 CONC came from England to Sydney in 1867 and he probably never lived with his 
1 CONC parents at all. It seems likely that his brothers and sisters may never 
1 CONC have known he existed.
1 CONT
1 CONT On her death certificate, Mary's father James Wilcox is described as 
1 CONC "gentleman" and her birth place as Colsterworth, Lincolnshire. This is a 
1 CONC small town eight miles south of Grantham, which suggests that James may 
1 CONC have had an estate there.

1 CONT NORTH COAST WRECK
1 CONT
1 CONT STEAMER ROSEDALE AGROUND ON BELLINGER RIVER BAR
1 CONT
1 CONT PASSENGERS AND CREW SAFELY LANDED
1 CONT
1 CONT The North Coast Is the scene of another wreck, and the pioneer company of 
1 CONC this coastal service is again the victim. The steamer Rosedale, owned by 
1 CONC the North Coast Steam Navigation Company, Ltd, which left Sydney on 
1 CONC Monday night, arrived off the Bellinger bar on Wednesday evening, and 
1 CONC whilst endeavouring to make the entrance, in charge of the tug, she 
1 CONC grounded on the sandspit at about 5 pm. She remained hard and fast 
1 CONC overnight. Despite all efforts to shift her, her position only became 
1 CONC worse. The wind at tbe time was blowing hard from the north-east, and a 
1 CONC heavy sea was rolling in. While it was evident that the position of the 
1 CONC ship was becoming more and more dangerous, tho passengers, who could not 
1 CONC be got off, spent an anxious night listening to the seas crash ing over 
1 CONC the vessel. The forces caused her to work and swing round a little.
1 CONT
1 CONT Yesterday morning the passengers were safely landed on the sea wall, 
1 CONC their names being Messrs F. and W. Mather, A Ball and 2 children, and Mr 
1 CONC Louat. This landing was made possible by the Rosedale, which was full of 
1 CONC water, being shifted from the sandspit to tho inside wall of the south 
1 CONC breakwater. According to news wired to the Superintendent of the 
1 CONC Department of Navigation, the position the vessel is now in Is one of 
1 CONC extreme gravity, and the prospects of refloating her are considered to be 
1 CONC very remote. The wind was reported as being from the north-east, and the 
1 CONC sea was said to be still very rough.
1 CONT
1 CONT This is not tho first time the Rosedale has been in a dangerous position 
1 CONC at the Bellinger Heads. On ono previous occasion she was almost reduced 
1 CONC to a total wreck. The navigation of this bar is always hazardous, 
1 CONC especially so since the schooner Elliston was wrecked there some years 
1 CONC ago. Captain J. O. Anderson, who had command of the Rosedale, knows this 
1 CONC coast thoroughly, and has had considerable experlence in negotiating the 
1 CONC bar. When, therefore, an accident occurs under his command, shipping 
1 CONC people are prepared to admit that the danger is even worse than is 
1 CONC supposed. The Elliston lies submerged right In the fairway and it is 
1 CONC supposed that in trying to avoid this obstruction in the heavy seaway, 
1 CONC that the Rosedale came to grief. Ship masters have repeatedly described 
1 CONC this obstruction as a menace to navigation. Only quite lately 
1 CONC representations on this point were made to the Department of Public 
1 CONC Works. Probably now that an accident has occuired the authorities will 
1 CONC remove the cause of complaint. Not only is this sunken wreck a menace, 
1 CONC but the bar itself has to be negotiated with extreme caution. Steamers 
1 CONC are seldom able to load to their full capacity. They have often to leave 
1 CONC stacks of produce behind to lessen their draught. Some have been 
1 CONC bar-bound for over a week, including the Rosedale herself.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Rosedale is an iron twin screw steamer of 274 tons, built In Dundee 
1 CONC in 1877 by W B Thompson. She has a length of 140ft, a breadth of 26ft and 
1 CONC a depth of 8ft 6in.

1 CONC instead to Sydney. From the Death Notice below this appears to have been 
1 CONC about 1862.

1 CONT Pierre was an engineer whose home was "L'Hirondelle", 34 (now 26) Dock 
1 CONC Road, Balmain.   Pierre purchased the land from Thomas Sutcliffe Mort on

1 CONC native of Lyons, France where his father was a landed proprietor, he was 
1 CONC a colonist of 40 years standing and for 25 years resided at Balmain, 
1 CONC close to the Morts Docks works.   As superintendent of one of the

1 CONC for health reasons.  He had been declining for some time past and about a

1 CONC Henry Henry was a famous prewar aviator and navigator who captained small 
1 CONC ships around Papua-New Guinea during and after World War II.  He was 
1 CONC attributed to have flown under Sydney Harbour Bridge in an aircraft.
1 CONT
1 CONT I have an account of Goya's life on file from "Those Magnificent 
1 CONC Men...Those Intrepid Women",
1 CONT
1 CONT HENRY GOYA (1901-1974), aviator and shipmaster, was born on 17 June 1901 
1 CONC at Grafton, New South Wales, third son of Thomas James Henry, medical 
1 CONC practitioner, and his wife Emily, n�e Stephen, a great-granddaughter of 
1 CONC John Stephen. Known as Goya, Henry was educated at Grafton High School. 
1 CONC He made one voyage in a sailing ship; hoping to transfer later to 
1 CONC medicine, he studied science at the University of Sydney in 1922-23. At 
1 CONC St Matthew's Church, Windsor, on 11 April 1925 he married Marjory Alison 
1 CONC Pursehouse, schoolteacher. He worked as a clerk.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Qualifying for a private flying licence on 28 January 1928, Henry was 
1 CONC issued with a commercial licence on 6 June 1929, which he used 
1 CONC principally in a barnstorming venture. On 6 July 1930, flying a Junkers 
1 CONC Junior monoplane, he was caught in bad weather and crashed at Manly, 
1 CONC killing his passenger and losing much of one leg. With a successful 
1 CONC artificial leg, he eventually regained his commercial licence in 1932 and 
1 CONC was employed by Air Taxi Ltd. About 1934 he bought a Genairco biplane, 
1 CONC decorated it with a 'Jolly Roger' and used it for joy-rides.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT In September 1934 Henry's licence was suspended for a fortnight for 
1 CONC breaches of the air navigation regulations. Considering the sentence 
1 CONC unjust, he defied the order: his licence was suspended indefinitely and 
1 CONC he was prosecuted. Henry's brother Alfred Stephen, a solicitor, launched 
1 CONC proceedings in the High Court of Australia in October 1934 for an order 
1 CONC nisi. While judgment was pending Henry was charged with further offences, 
1 CONC his licence was suspended again and he was forbidden to enter any 
1 CONC aerodrome. The Henry brothers appealed again to the High Court for an 
1 CONC injunction. In 1936 the High Court ruled in respect of the action of 
1 CONC October 1934 that the Commonwealth had a right to regulate flights but 
1 CONC only in conformity with international conventions on the subject; the 
1 CONC court considered that the regulations in dispute did not accord with 
1 CONC those conventions. The parties then agreed out of court that on the 
1 CONC payment of damages by the Commonwealth, the injunction application would 
1 CONC be struck out. Charged by a flight controller at Mascot during the 
1 CONC ensuing temporary confusion with flying below the prescribed height, 
1 CONC Henry appealed, this time unsuccessfully to the High Court.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT After a verdict against him in the District Court, arising from a 
1 CONC collision while taking off from Mascot, Henry was bankrupted in October 
1 CONC 1938 and was not discharged until September 1940. Debarred by his 
1 CONC artificial leg from the Royal Australian Air Force at the start of World 
1 CONC War II, he joined the small ships unit of the United States Army in 1943 
1 CONC and sailed a small work boat around New Guinea. After the war he worked 
1 CONC for the Papua-New Guinea division of the Directorate of Shipping as mate 
1 CONC on the Kelanoa plying between Rabaul and Kavieng, and as master of the 
1 CONC Matoko in 1950-51. When the shipping service was taken over by the 
1 CONC administration of Papua-New Guinea, he became master of the Thetis 
1 CONC sailing up and down the Sepik River. He retired about 1963 and returned 
1 CONC to Sydney; although his flying licence had lapsed he tried to revive 
1 CONC contact with aviation. He died childless at Manly of arteriosclerosis on 
1 CONC 14 July 1974 and was cremated.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Short, fair, straight-backed and nimble in spite of his disability, Henry 
1 CONC became a New Guinea character. He had collected and sold snakes for many 
1 CONC years, thereby reinforcing his reputation as a daredevil. In later years 
1 CONC he suffered from some alcoholic excess.

1 CONT BETWEEN the wars Henry Goya Henry was the acknowledged pirate of the 
1 CONC Australian skies. Not just because of the skull and crossbones painted on 
1 CONC his bright red Genairco plane, nicknamed the Jolly Roger, which he used 
1 CONC for joy flights over Sydney Harbour. Nor because, like Long John Silver, 
1 CONC he had lost one of his legs, the result of an accident in July 1930, when 
1 CONC his monoplane crashed at Manly, killing his passenger. His piratical 
1 CONC reputation was mainly the result of his perpetual flouting of aviation 
1 CONC laws � most dramatically in 1936 when he became the first pilot to fly 
1 CONC (illegally) under the newly built Sydney Harbour Bridge, at a time when 
1 CONC his licence was suspended. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Henry Goya to friend and foe, died childless in 1974. But his daredevil 
1 CONC legacy lives on thanks to the Powerhouse Museum, which has paid $125,000 
1 CONC for the Jolly Roger, his most famous plane. According to Ian Debenham, 
1 CONC the museum�s transport curator, the Jolly Roger deserves to be as much of 
1 CONC a celebrity as the man who flew it. "Genairco VH-UOG is a very 
1 CONC significant plane", he said. It was one of nine designed and built by the 
1 CONC General Aircraft Company in Mascot between 1929 and 1933, when the 
1 CONC company folded. And that makes the Genairco the first aircraft series to 
1 CONC be designed and manufactured in Australia. Only three Genaircos survive. 
1 CONC Originally they were designed to house the locally made Harkness Hornet 
1 CONC engine, the first Australian aircraft engine to be considered for 
1 CONC airworthiness approval by the Department of Civil Aviation. 
1 CONC Unfortunately, the Australian engine was not as good as its overseas 
1 CONC rivals, so was never commercially viable. However, the original prototype 
1 CONC is also in the Powerhouse collection. Henry�s father bought the Genairco 
1 CONC for him in 1935, a year after his first conviction for contravening air 
1 CONC navigation regulations. By July 1936 the authorities were so exasperated 
1 CONC by his maverick ways his licence was suspended again. A few days later he 
1 CONC flew under the Harbour Bridge to spite them. That same year the High 
1 CONC Court ruled in his favour against the Commonwealth, which had sought to 
1 CONC suspend him indefinitely. But his flying days were nearly over. After 
1 CONC another crash when taking off from Mascot, Henry was bankrupted in 1938. 
1 CONC He tried to join the Royal Australian Air Force at the start of World War 
1 CONC II, but was ruled out because of his artificial leg. Instead he joined 
1 CONC the small ships unit of the United States Army in 1943, based in New 
1 CONC Guinea where he spent most of the rest of his working life.

1 CONT Letter written to the editor of Aviation Heritage, the magazine of AHSA, 
1 CONC the Aviation Historical Society of Australia by Warwick Henry.
1 CONT
1 CONT "I must, however take issue with the statement (second column, first 
1 CONC page):"At the time trade and commerce between the states was taxed. To 
1 CONC avoid having to pay air tax between the States, Goya simply landed on one 
1 CONC side of the border, then folded the Genairco's wings, wheeled it across 
1 CONC the border then unfolded the wings before flying away in the legally safe 
1 CONC knowledge that as he had not flown the aircraft across the state border, 
1 CONC taxation could not be imposed."
1 CONT
1 CONT I take issue not with the statement that he wheeled the Genairco across 
1 CONC the border but why.
1 CONT
1 CONT There was never an "air tax" on interstate aviation. Indeed since 
1 CONC Federation on 1 January 1901, Section 92 of the Australian Constitution 
1 CONC has expressly prohibited any taxation on interstate commerce.
1 CONT
1 CONT Goya did indeed on one occasion land at Albury, crossed the bridge over 
1 CONC the Murray and flew away from Wodonga. This was during the protracted 
1 CONC court battles he was waging, the nub of which he contended, was that the 
1 CONC Commonwealth had power only over interstate aviation, not intrastate. 
1 CONC That was the reason for his avoidance of an interstate flight at that 
1 CONC time.
1 CONT
1 CONT I discussed this with Goya in the late nineteen-sixties when visiting him 
1 CONC after meeting him at an AHSA meeting in Sydney where he was a guest as 
1 CONC one of the "Early Birds", i.e. people who had been pilots before WWII.  
1 CONC Goya was my father's cousin; however I had not met him until then as he 
1 CONC had lived in New Guinea until he returned to Sydney in his twilight years.
1 CONT
1 CONT Shortly after the publication of that edition of Aviation Heritage came 
1 CONC the news, published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 21-23 Dec 2007 under 
1 CONC the headline: "Once a jolly daredevil�pilot's legacy is museum's trophy" 
1 CONC that Goya's Genairco, Jolly Roger has been sold to the Powerhouse Museum, 
1 CONC Sydney for $125.000. 
1 CONT
1 CONT The Genairco had been an exhibit at Air World, Wangaratta until that 
1 CONC collection was dispersed in recent years.  I seriously considered buying 
1 CONC it myself with view to restoration but decided that my pockets might not 
1 CONC be deep enough! To think that at that time they were asking $70,000.

1 CONC James Rutledge's mother died when he was two years old and he was reared 
1 CONC by his grandmother Shannon until he was nine when his father took him 
1 CONC back to his own home.  With the death of his father he was forced to 
1 CONC abandon his plan of entering the ministry and instead decided to try his 
1 CONC fortune in NSW.  He sailed for Australia on 8 June 1840 on the "Lord 
1 CONC Western" and arrived in Sydney on 3 October 1840.  His brother, Thomas 
1 CONC and sister, Margaret came on the same ship. 
1 CONT
1 CONT The following month, James proceeded to the tiny settlement of Upper 
1 CONC Castlereagh on the Nepean River.  In December 1840 he commenced his 
1 CONC position as a teacher at the Wesleyan School which was in the Wesleyan 
1 CONC Church and he also preached as a lay preacher.  The original chapel was 
1 CONC the first Wesleyan Church in Australia and was opened on 7 October 1817. 
1 CONC It was here that James met Lucy Ann Field. 
1 CONT
1 CONT The present church was built in 1847 and opened on 16 February. It was 
1 CONC partly through the efforts of James who conducted "Tea Parties" to raise 
1 CONC the funds.   Around early 1849 the family moved to Parramatta for several 
1 CONC years where James taught at The Kings School.  In 1851 James and his 
1 CONC family moved to Drayton, Queensland and then returned to NSW at 
1 CONC Clarencetown in May 1855.

1 CONT
1 CONT THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S FATHER.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Hon. A. Rutledge, Attorney-General, returned to Brisbane on Tuesday 
1 CONC night from Sydney, where he was summoned to be present at the deathbed of 
1 CONC his father, Mr. James Rutledge. Unhappily, the Attorney-General arrived 
1 CONC at Sydney too late to see Mr. Rut ledge, sen., alive, but was present at 
1 CONC the funeral, which took place on Monday afternoon. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. James Rutledge was born in County Leitrim, Ireland, on the 24th May 
1 CONC 1817, and was educated with a view to enter ing the ministry of the 
1 CONC Wesleyan Church. Owing to the death of his father this course was not 
1 CONC followed, and Mr. Rutledge came out to Australia in 1840. After a short 
1 CONC residence in Sydney he went to Castlereagh and engaged in teaching. Later 
1 CONC on he was appointed to the charge of the Wesleyan school at Parramatta. 
1 CONC He entered the service of the New South Wales Board of Education nearly 
1 CONC half-a-century ago, and continued to serve until 1871, holding the post 
1 CONC of head master in several localities. In 1871 Mr. Rutledge entered upon 
1 CONC the profession ot Journalism, and. was for years a regular contributor to 
1 CONC the "Empire," under Sir Henry Parkes and Messrs. Hanson and Bennett. 
1 CONC Naturally, much of his journalistic work bore upon the system of 
1 CONC education, and he is credited by the "S. M. Herald" with having 
1 CONC materially assisted in laying the foundations of the present Public 
1 CONC School Act of New South Wales. Later on Mr. Rutledge became editor of the 
1 CONC "Newcastle Chronicle" and his vigorous pen and general capacity as a 
1 CONC journalist soon made the "Chronicle" an important element in the 
1 CONC Journalistic work of the mother colony. Mr. Rutledge was a trenchant 
1 CONC writer, and possessed of much enterprise. He was able in his paper to 
1 CONC give the world the first intimation of the sensational escape of 
1 CONC Rochefort, Oliver Pain, and other famous French political prisoners from 
1 CONC New Caledonia, and the " Chronicle" under his literary management was 
1 CONC well known by the smartness of its shipping news, the chief item of 
1 CONC interest in Newcastle twenty-fiye years ago. Mr. Rutledge relinquished 
1 CONC the editorship of the paper, being succeeded by Mr. T. Corrigan. and 
1 CONC later on, when the "Chronicle" had  been absorbed by the "Herald and 
1 CONC Miners' Advocate" a daily paper� by Mr. James Inglis ("Maori"), who was 
1 CONC later a 
1 CONT Minister for Education in New South Wales. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge continued his journalistic work for some years, and though 
1 CONC he has lived in retirement of late, he has continued to take a keen 
1 CONC Interest in public affairs. He was a conspicuous figure physically, well 
1 CONC over 6 ft. in height, and a man of singularly robust frame. Those who had 
1 CONC the privilege of knowing Mr. James Rutledge in the seventies speak warmly 
1 CONC of his kindly nature, and he has by encouragement and example helped on 
1 CONC many who now occupy good positions on the Press in Australia. He leaves 
1 CONC four sons and four daughters. The eldest son is the Attorney-General of 
1 CONC Queensland, another is the Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge, of Waverley, Sydney, 
1 CONC a polished writer and trenchant speaker; and another the Rev. Dr. David 
1 CONC Rutledge, M.D., M.A., of Mittagong, New South Wales, who has also had 
1 CONC journalistic experience, and when quite a youth was a very fine platform 
1 CONC speaker and preacher.

1 CONT
1 CONT In 1878 he was admitted to the Queensland Bar and in the same year

1 CONC From about 1883 to 1893 he represented the seat of Charters Towers.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1896 he was appointed Crown Prosecutor for The Southern District of

1 CONC Fitzgerald for 6 days)
1 CONT
1 CONT As Attorney-General of Queensland he was involved with the forming of the 
1 CONC Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia.  In 1891 he was the 
1 CONC Queensland delegate at the Federal Convention in Sydney, chaired by Sir 
1 CONC Henry Parkes, which laid down the principles of the Federal 
1 CONC Constitution.  
1 CONT
1 CONT He became a QC in 1899, which was changed to KC in 1901 when King Edward 
1 CONC VII acceded the throne.  In 1899 also, Queen Victoria conferred upon 
1 CONC Arthur the title of "Honourable" with the right to wear the Windsor 
1 CONC uniform of an Executive Councillor.
1 CONT
1 CONT At the time of Federation in May 1901, he was also acting Premier of 
1 CONC Queensland. He can be seen at the Federation Ceremony in Melbourne in the 
1 CONC presence of the Duke and Duchess of York.  This event is recorded on a 
1 CONC huge painting by Tom Roberts which today hangs in the Parliament House, 
1 CONC Canberra.
1 CONT
1 CONT In the Coronation Honours on 27 June 1902 he was knighted as a  Knight 
1 CONC Bachelor.  In 1902 he was returned for the seat of Maranoa and in 1905,

1 CONT His address in 1903 is listed as 11 Adelaide Street, Brisbane: P.R. 
1 CONC Latrobe Terrace, Paddington (on the right side from Given Terrace, at the 
1 CONC last house, corner Fernberg Road).  A report in "The Telegraph" on 7 
1 CONC August 1902 describes Lady Rutledge's "At Home" at Garfield which was 
1 CONC probably at the above address.
1 CONT
1 CONT Arthur took ill on the train while travelling back to Queensland from 
1 CONC Victoria. He left the train in Sydney and was taken to Athelston Private 
1 CONC Hospital, Manly, where he died.  Throughout Brisbane flags were flown at 
1 CONC half-mast and the Art Gallery (where he was Chairman) was closed.  Arthur 
1 CONC and Mary are buried in Brisbane at Toowong Cemetery (Portion 13, Section 
1 CONC 49, Allotment 15).
1 CONT
1 CONT Reference to the photo of Lucinda in the scrapbook
1 CONT Sir Arthur and the Premier of Queensland, Sir Samuel Griffith travelled 
1 CONC to Sydney on the Queensland government steamship Lucinda to participate 
1 CONC in the federation Convention. During the Easter weekend of 27-29 March 
1 CONC 1891, they made a cruise in the Lucinda to the Hawkesbury River, taking 
1 CONC with them Kingston and Barton, and picking up Inglis Clark on the Sunday. 
1 CONC During the cruise, this drafting sub-committee finalised the draft of the 
1 CONC 1891 Constitution. Through its association with the Australian 
1 CONC Constitution, the Lucinda has become a symbol of Australian democracy.

1 CONT Sir Arthur Rutledge by A. Meston
1 CONT
1 CONT The death of Sir Arthur Rutledge of Queensland recalls to me many 
1 CONC memories of the by-gone years.
1 CONT
1 CONT About four weeks ago I met Sir Arthur and Lady Rutledge in King Street, 
1 CONC and he and I compared notes, over the days when we were members of the 
1 CONC Queensland Parliament in 1879. He and I were returned in November 1878 - 
1 CONC he for Enoggera and I for Rosewood. For three years we sat side by side 
1 CONC on the front cross Opposition benches with T. M. Donald Paterson and 
1 CONC Bailey of Wide Bay.
1 CONT
1 CONT My first acquaintance with Sir Arthur Rutledge was in 1873 at Grafton on 
1 CONC the Clarence River. He was then a clergyman of the Wesleyan Church. He 
1 CONC had come from the Macleay River, where he had also been a clergyman, in 
1 CONC the days when there were sugar mills on that river, the first sugar 
1 CONC growing district in Australia, the industry being credited to old Thomas 
1 CONC Scott, who introduced the first sugar cane to Australia in 1824.
1 CONT
1 CONT Arthur Rutledge came to Grafton in 1873, and was minister of the Wesleyan 
1 CONC Church in Prince Street. When he sold off, with the intention of going to 
1 CONC Queensland, I bought most of his furniture, including his breadboard, 
1 CONC still in my possession, and marked ?Spare Not!?
1 CONT
1 CONT He was elected to the Queensland Parliament in the days when the 
1 CONC M?Ilwraith Ministry superseded the Douglas Ministry, and we went through 
1 CONC all the trouble and turmoil of the steel rail discussion that poisoned 
1 CONC the political atmosphere of Queensland for years.
1 CONT
1 CONT In after years, when Rutledge decided to study for the law, he 
1 CONC interviewed his friend, George Cowlishaw, one of the proprietors of the 
1 CONC Brisbane ?Telegraph?. Mr. Cowlishaw strongly advised him to study for the 
1 CONC Bar, and when Rutledge queried how he was going to live in the meantime 
1 CONC Cowlishaw promptly responded, and paid Rutledge 500 pounds per annum for 
1 CONC five years. Every penny of that money was honourably returned by Rutledge 
1 CONC when he achieved his richly-deserved success at the Bar.
1 CONT
1 CONT Looking back at those old days, I have the painful remembrance that only 
1 CONC of the 55 members returned in November 1878 there are now only five left 
1 CONC alive!
1 CONT
1 CONT Sir Arthur Rutledge was a man with all the fine feelings and delicate 
1 CONC intuitions and just sympathies of a gentleman, and the fine regard for 
1 CONC the feelings of others, which after all is the one infallible sign of a 
1 CONC gentleman.
1 CONT
1 CONT In this brief eulogy of an old friend I feel the ?bitter constraint and 
1 CONC sad occasion dear? of Milton over Lycidas, and much of Shelley?s sorrow 
1 CONC in his ?Adonals? over his beloved Keats. Shall I be debarred from 
1 CONC mourning over the dear friend who sat beside me, with all men?s respect, 
1 CONC in the ?dear dead days beyond recall??

1 CONT -----------
1 CONT
1 CONT RUTLEDGE, Sir ARTHUR (1843-1917), preacher, barrister, politician and 
1 CONC judge, was born on 29 August 1843 at Penrith, New South Wales, son of 
1 CONC James Rutledge, schoolmaster, and his wife Lucy, n�e Field. His father's 
1 CONC work took the family to Drayton, Darling Downs, Moreton Bay District, in 
1 CONC 1851-55, then to Sydney. Arthur began work in legal and mercantile 
1 CONC occupations in 1859, intending to enter the legal profession. In 1865, 
1 CONC however, he was ordained a Wesleyan minister. He married Mary Thomas 
1 CONC Rabone at Surry Hills on 24 March 1869. His ministry took him to rural 
1 CONC areas of New South Wales and to Brisbane, where he settled after 1875. 
1 CONC Rutledge left the ministry, encouraged and supported financially by 
1 CONC George Cowlishaw, to study law. He was called to the Queensland Bar in 
1 CONC 1878.
1 CONT After unsuccessfully contesting the parliamentary seat of North Brisbane, 
1 CONC Rutledge stood for Enoggera, which elected him and (Sir) James Dickson. 
1 CONC He became a leading opponent of the first McIlwraith government. When 
1 CONC prominent Liberal politicians were persuaded to secure rural seats to win 
1 CONC office for (Sir) Samuel Griffith, Rutledge stood for Kennedy and, with 
1 CONC his 'force and charm as a platform speaker', topped the poll in October 
1 CONC 1883. Premier Griffith, who became his lifelong friend, appointed him 
1 CONC attorney-general. Following an electoral redistribution, Rutledge's 
1 CONC anti-separatist stance found favour at Charters Towers, which 
1 CONC overwhelmingly returned him in May 1888. The government, however, lost 
1 CONC office in June. When the Queensland parliament was invited to send 
1 CONC delegates to the 1891 National Australasian Convention in Sydney, 
1 CONC Rutledge was chosen as one of its seven representatives.
1 CONT
1 CONT After his retirement from politics on 13 May 1893, Rutledge returned to 
1 CONC the Bar. He accepted appointment as crown prosecutor for the Southern 
1 CONC Supreme Court on 20 December 1895. But the attraction of politics proved 
1 CONC too strong: he resigned his position and stood for Maranoa in March 1899. 
1 CONC Promoted by the Wesleyan connexions of the Brisbane Courier, he defeated 
1 CONC the popular Independent Labor incumbent Robert King. Rutledge became 
1 CONC attorney-general in Dickson's ministry and, later that year, was 
1 CONC appointed Q.C. A member of the royal commission to scrutinize the draft 
1 CONC code of criminal law and the bill to establish the code in 1899, Rutledge 
1 CONC introduced and carried legislation prepared by Griffith.
1 CONT
1 CONT He was briefly out of office during the short tenure of the Dawson 
1 CONC government in December 1899. In 1901 he was acting premier during (Sir) 
1 CONC Robert Philp's absence and was knighted in June 1902 following the visit 
1 CONC of the Duke and Duchess of York. When Philp was forced to resign as 
1 CONC premier on 17 September 1903, Rutledge tried in vain to form a cabinet. 
1 CONC He became leader of the Opposition when Philp declined, but failed to 
1 CONC secure the suburban seat of Nundah in the 1904 election. During 1904-05 
1 CONC he twice held commissions as an acting judge of the Supreme Court.
1 CONT
1 CONT On 22 March 1906 Rutledge was appointed judge of District Courts, and 
1 CONC held this office for the rest of his life, despite criticisms. During 
1 CONC this period he also acted in rotation with his fellow judges as chairman 
1 CONC of the Land Appeal Court. He was a painstaking, conscientious judge and 
1 CONC 'a gentleman of the good old school'. Rutledge married Rose Ann Davey in 
1 CONC Melbourne on 21 June 1910. Survived by his wife, and three sons and four 
1 CONC daughters of his first marriage, he died in Sydney on 8 February 1917 and 
1 CONC was buried in Toowong cemetery, Brisbane

1 CONT Medical Students before the turn of the century
1 CONT From Faculty of Medicine Online Museum and Archive
1 CONT
1 CONT 1883 was the first year that students were accepted for undergraduate 
1 CONC training in the Faculty of Medicine. These students were from quite 
1 CONC different social backgrounds to the wealthy university gentlemen of the 
1 CONC previous decades.[1] The Faculty was attracting a more inclusive cohort 
1 CONC of medical students, which reflected the changing times as Sydney moved 
1 CONC towards the dawn of the twentieth century. Many were Australian born and 
1 CONC came from middle-class and increasingly from working-class families; 
1 CONC children of schoolmasters, wheelwrights, mining agents, stonecutters, 
1 CONC accountants and pharmacists. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Medical Students 1887.   
1 CONT The first year, six candidates enrolled in Medicine II. Of these, only 
1 CONC one graduated, David Dunlop Rutledge, and he did so only after repeating 
1 CONC a year. Four of the remainder quickly discontinued but one, Ernest 
1 CONC Theodore Holle, persisted until 1889. In the second intake (1884) there 
1 CONC were ten new students and two students repeating the year (both of whom 
1 CONC ultimately discontinued). Of the ten, five graduated in minimum time 
1 CONC (Bancroft, Perkins, Armstrong, Arthur Geddes Henry, and Davidson) and one 
1 CONC (Kelly) graduated after repeating a year; the remaining four 
1 CONC discontinued. In the third intake there were fifteen students, including 
1 CONC the first woman to enroll in Medicine in Australia, Dagmar Berne. Two 
1 CONC other students were repeating from the previous year but ultimately 
1 CONC discontinued. Six of the remaining thirteen graduated in minimum time and 
1 CONC one (W. J. Sherlow) graduated as late as 1892 after repeating several 
1 CONC years. Dagmar Berne did not graduate from the University of Sydney. 
1 CONC Overall, of the twenty-nine candidates who enrolled in the first three 
1 CONC intakes, eleven graduated in minimum time and three after repeating one 
1 CONC or more years. Confidence in the quality of the medical program 
1 CONC encouraged increased enrolments, so that by 1893, ten years after its 
1 CONC inception, the student body numbered close to one hundred. By the time of 
1 CONC the University�s Jubilee in 1902, this number had nearly doubled.

1 CONT Governor Marie Bashir relives Sutton Forest�s vice-regal era
1 CONT ROBYN MURRAY
1 CONT 04 Nov, 2009 08:51 AM
1 CONT SINCE taking over Parish of Sutton Forest about 18 months ago, the 
1 CONC Reverend Jeremy Tonks has often wondered what it would be like to have 
1 CONC the NSW Governor attend services at All Saint�s Anglican Church, as in 
1 CONC the days when nearby Hillview was an official vice-regal residence.
1 CONT �I can die happy now,� Mr Tonks told NSW Governor Marie Bashir when she 
1 CONC joined his congregation on Sunday, becoming the 18th Governor to worship 
1 CONC at All Saints. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Horsemen from the 1st/21st NSW Lancers re-enactment group escorted 
1 CONC Professor Bashir and her husband Sir Nicholas Shehadie from the gates of 
1 CONC Hillview to All Saints Church, where their vehicle passed through the 
1 CONC �Governor�s gates� which were moved to the church from Hillview in 1959.
1 CONT
1 CONT Professor Bashir unveiled a plaque marking the completion of repairs to 
1 CONC the 148-year-old church, made possible by a bequest from former Berrima 
1 CONC District Historical Society archivist Janet Cosh. 
1 CONT
1 CONT After the service, she also unveiled a plaque marking the grave of former 
1 CONC Sutton Forest rector, the Reverend Dr David Rutledge,
1 CONT
1 CONT Dr Rutledge was in the first intake of six students to the Faculty of 
1 CONC Medicine at the University of Sydney. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Since he was the only one of the group to complete the course he was 
1 CONC notionally the faculty�s first graduate. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He served as rector of St Stephen�s Mittagong from 1896 and became the 
1 CONC Rector of Sutton Forest in 1904. 
1 CONT
1 CONT �As a medical graduate and now Chancellor of the University of Sydney, 
1 CONC I�m deeply touched to join you on this occasion,� Professor Bashir said. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Professor Bashir said her All Saints� Day visit to the church was a �joy 
1 CONC and a privilege�. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Built in Australia�s colonial days, All Saints Church was a legacy to all 
1 CONC Australians through its association with Bishop Broughton, the Reverend 
1 CONC Thomas Hassall and its architect, Edmund Blacket, who also designed the 
1 CONC quadrangle and Great Hall at the University of Sydney, she said. 
1 CONT
1 CONT University of Sydney Medical Alumni Association president Paul Lancaster 
1 CONC and Dr Rutledge�s great-granddaughters Glenda Sherwin-Lane and Vivien 
1 CONC Dunkerley joined Professor Bashir at the service. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Professor Bashir also visited the grave of James Park, head coachman to 
1 CONC Governor Harry Rawson. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr Park drowned at Fitzroy Falls on January 20, 1903. Governor and Lady 
1 CONC Rawson erected the headstone as a mark of esteem, but over the years it 
1 CONC was damaged and lay in the ground in a number of pieces until All Saints 
1 CONC cemetery trustees had it restored in 2003.

1 CONT
1 CONT DEATH IN BRISBANE.
1 CONT
1 CONT One of the most prominent mining pioneers in Queensland, Mr. Cliff 
1 CONC Rutledge, who devoted practically a lifetime to mining activities, died 
1 CONC in Brisbane yesterday. He was well known on all big mining fields in this 
1 CONC State and in New Guinea, particularly in the hinterland of Cairns.
1 CONT
1 CONT In the boom days of the Etheridge and Croydon goldfields he invested 
1 CONC large sums of money in various ventures and those investments returned to 
1 CONC him handsome rewards. Probably no name was more familiar in the mining 
1 CONC fields of North Queensland than that of Cliff Rutledge. Apart from 
1 CONC reaping excellent rewards from the wealth of the mining fields, he had 
1 CONC always offered financial help and imparted expert knowledge to many 
1 CONC others engaged in the industry, and his passing will represent a big loss 
1 CONC to the industry and the departure of a great friend to many.    
1 CONT
1 CONT Prior to the Japanese invasion in the Pacific, the late Mr. Rutledge was 
1 CONC manager of the Missima mines in New Guinea, and he was in New Guinea when 
1 CONC the first enemy bombs, were dropped. Following the evacuation of 
1 CONC residents from New Guinea his ability and knowledge were availed of by 
1 CONC the Federal Government, and he was appointed to organise production of 
1 CONC ores in Queensland which were urgently required for war purposes.
1 CONT
1 CONT After leaving New Guinea he established his home at Coorparoo, Brisbane 
1 CONC where his widow at present resides. Apart from his widow he leaves two 
1 CONC daughters. Mrs. G. Kiernan, of Cairns and Miss Peggy Rutledge, of 
1 CONC Brisbane. Another daughter, Daphne, who was employed by the AM.P. Society 
1 CONC at Cairns, died some-years ago.
1 CONT
1 CONT Many years ago deceased's father was Premier of Queensland, and 
1 CONC subsequently was a District Court Judge.

1 CONC Charles Brunsdon Fletcher (1859-1946), surveyor and journalist, was born 
1 CONC on 5 August 1859 at Taunton, Somerset, England, third of thirteen 
1 CONC children of Charles Fletcher, silk throwster, and his wife Ruth, n�e 
1 CONC Bloor. In 1864 his father followed his eldest brother, Joseph Horner 
1 CONC Fletcher, to New Zealand aboard the Surat to assist in the Wesleyan world 
1 CONC mission service; he moved on to Sydney in 1872. Charles junior attended 
1 CONC Newington College, where Joseph Horner was then principal and another 
1 CONC uncle, John, a teacher, and the Fort Street Model School. He became a 
1 CONC cadet in the Survey Department of New South Wales, progressing to 
1 CONC supernumerary draftsman in 1879 and field assistant in 1881, after which 
1 CONC he worked on the Detail Survey of the City of Sydney. Moving to Brisbane 
1 CONC to assist in his father's real estate business in 1884, he obtained his 
1 CONC Queensland survey licence next year, began private practice, and served 
1 CONC on the Board of Examiners of Licensed Surveyors in 1888-93.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1893, when the land boom in Brisbane was ended by floods and bank 
1 CONC crashes, Fletcher chose journalism as an alternative profession, having 
1 CONC previously written for William Lane's Boomerang and been secretary of the 
1 CONC Brisbane Literary Circle. He joined the Brisbane Courier as leader-writer 
1 CONC and was also appointed Queensland correspondent of the Melbourne Argus. A 
1 CONC member of the Ithaca Shire Council in 1892-98 and president in 1894, he 
1 CONC succeeded F. W. Ward, his lifelong friend and fellow Wesleyan, as editor 
1 CONC of the Courier in 1898. On 13 November 1899 he and Florence Mary Macleay, 
1 CONC daughter of (Sir) Arthur Rutledge were the first couple to be married in 
1 CONC the Albert Street Wesleyan Church.
1 CONT
1 CONT Fletcher's success in journalism was due to a vigorous and incisive style 
1 CONC of writing and certain attitudes he hammered home in his articles�his 
1 CONC unswerving beliefs in the qualities of the Anglo-Saxon people; in 
1 CONC Imperialism; and in the prospect of a magnificent future for Australia. 
1 CONC In 1903 he returned to Sydney as associate editor of the Sydney Morning 
1 CONC Herald and capped his journalistic career with the editorship in 1918-37. 
1 CONC He was a member of the Australian delegation to the coronation of King 
1 CONC George V and Queen Mary in 1911, and in 1930 represented his paper at the 
1 CONC fourth Imperial Press Conference in London. President of the New South 
1 CONC Wales Institute of Journalists in 1923-27, it was through his efforts 
1 CONC that the course of diploma in journalism was introduced at the University 
1 CONC of Sydney, on the senate of which he served in 1923-39.
1 CONT
1 CONT Fletcher became recognized as an authority on Pacific affairs on which he 
1 CONC wrote three books, The New Pacific: British Policy and German Aims 
1 CONC (1917), The Problem of the Pacific (1919) and Stevenson's Germany: The 
1 CONC Case Against Germany in the Pacific (1920), all inspired by World War I 
1 CONC and Germany's expansionism. He urged a greater interest in the area by 
1 CONC Australian legislators, and co-operation between businessmen and 
1 CONC missionary bodies in its further development. This concern and, no doubt, 
1 CONC his memory of the enterprise of his father, his uncles Joseph Horner and 
1 CONC John, and his uncle William, who had been a missionary on the Island of 
1 CONC Rotumah, inspired his writing of The Black Knight of the Pacific (1944) 
1 CONC on the life and work of the famous Methodist missionary, Dr George Brown.
1 CONT
1 CONT Fletcher also wrote books on the Coolah (1927) and Murray (1926) valleys, 
1 CONC in New South Wales; the latter was followed up in Water Magic: Australia 
1 CONC and the Future (1945), an examination of the need for water conservation. 
1 CONC His autobiography, The Great Wheel: An Editor's Adventures (1940), 
1 CONC contains journalistic reminiscences and memoirs of public figures and 
1 CONC newspaper colleagues such as Ward, Charles Bean and F. M. Cutlack. His 
1 CONC personality, by all accounts, was an attractive one; acquaintances 
1 CONC recalled his 'charming old-world courtesy � keen powers of appreciation 
1 CONC and a broad, kindly outlook'. He was made a lay member of Wesley College 
1 CONC council in 1919. At his death, on 17 December 1946 at Kirribilli, the 
1 CONC Sydney Bulletin described him, for his 'constant mind' and 'honesty of 
1 CONC purpose', as one who 'would go down in history as the last Sydney editor 
1 CONC able to carry on the old dignified tradition of the great dailies'. He 
1 CONC was survived by two daughters and a son, his wife and another son having 
1 CONC predeceased him; his estate was valued for probate at �6329.
1 CONT
1 CONT Charles Brunsden Fletcher was originally a surveyor.  In 1902 he was the 
1 CONC editor of "The Courier" in Brisbane. He was later editor of "The Sydney 
1 CONC Morning Herald" until 1938 after 35 years with the paper.  He had been 
1 CONC Editor-in-Chief since about 1921.
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. C. Brunsdon Fletcher (Bio) editor 'Courier' December 25th 1898 to 
1 CONC April 4th, 1903, after a brilliant school and college career, qualified 
1 CONC as a surveyor and practised his profession in Queensland for some years. 
1 CONC He was one of Dr. Ward�s 'finds' and joined the staff of the Brisbane 
1 CONC Newspaper Company as a contributor to the 'Courier' and later became 
1 CONC regular leader writer for the 'Courier' and 'Observer.' On Dr. Ward�s 
1 CONC retirement from the editorship, Mr. Brunson Fletcher was appointed to the 
1 CONC position and, like his predecessor, was a keen newspaper man and a great 
1 CONC worker with a scholarly literary method and a fine knowledge of 
1 CONC Australian and Pacific affairs.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1903, Mr. Brunsdon Fletcher was offered and accepted the position of 
1 CONC Associate Editor of the 'Sydney Morning Herald,' and in the later months 
1 CONC of 1917, was appointed Editor. He took to the 'Herald' the good 
1 CONC experience and practical training in newspaper work obtained on the 
1 CONC 'Courier.' He is the author of valuable works on the Pacific. Mr. 
1 CONC Brunsdon Fletcher is above middle height, slight but as 'hard as nails,' 
1 CONC and has stood the test of long days in the field on Queensland surveys as 
1 CONC in burning the midnight oil as Editor of a daily paper. Mrs. Fletcher is 
1 CONC a daughter of the late Sir Arthur Rutledge, K.C. who did much for the 
1 CONC political life of Queensland and at the Bar.

1 CONC William arrived in Sydney in 1829 with his mother's brother Thomas who 
1 CONC was returning to Australia from Ireland as ship's surgeon.  William set 
1 CONC up as a contractor for government supplies and after 5 years he was 
1 CONC assigned 6 convicts.  In 1834 his address was Field of Mars, Parramatta.  
1 CONC In 1837 he acquired land on the Molonglo River near Queanbeyan.   He 
1 CONC overlanded in 1838 to Kilmore in the Westernport District.  He held land 
1 CONC there until 1841 when he acquired 3,000 acres near Warrnambool naming it 
1 CONC "Farnham Park".  Another report says he landed in Pt Fairy in 1843 when 
1 CONC it was known as Belfast.  A history of Port Fairy says "Then following 
1 CONC Atkinson, came William Rutledge - and the story of Belfast really 
1 CONC began..."   
1 CONT
1 CONT "Terrible  Billy", as he was known founded the woolbroking firm of 
1 CONC Rutledge & Co in 1848 when his brother-in-law, Horace Flower joined him 
1 CONC in partnership. 
1 CONT The history continues "...when the clippers from overseas anchored in the 
1 CONC bay and the ships of Rutledge & Co carried wheat and wool direct to 
1 CONC London"  
1 CONT
1 CONT The Port Fairy Gazette on 19 December 1899 said of the new partnership 
1 CONC "the result being the establishment of the colossal firm known from the 
1 CONC Murray to the sea as Rutledge and Co.  For many years the business 
1 CONC flourished, the transactions during the period running into a value which 
1 CONC could only be described with the aid of seven figures, but in 1863, the 
1 CONC crash came.  'The Rutledge', as the firm was familiarly styled, ceased to 
1 CONC exist and a great gloom fell upon Port Fairy".
1 CONT
1 CONT The history also says  "...a look at that part which was once the very 
1 CONC power-house of Belfast: the Rutledge properties.  At No 8 Cox Street, 
1 CONC William Rutledge's 'Big House' still stands, the front and 1885 addition: 
1 CONC a home famous in its day for the hospitality which Rolf Boldrewood has so 
1 CONC feelingly recorded.  Between No 8 and the corner of Gipps Street, and 
1 CONC along the river side of Gipps Street are the sections of bluestone wall 
1 CONC which are all that remains of the great warehouses of Rutledge & Co, 
1 CONC which once ran down to the river and overflowed to form another 
1 CONC collection of buildings on the eastern bank. 
1 CONT
1 CONT From 1843 to 1862 the short, stocky, quick tempered dynamo of a man, 
1 CONC William Rutledge and his partner, Horace Flower, of Rugby School and 
1 CONC Trinity College, Cambridge were the driving force of Belfast.  The firm 
1 CONC were shipowners, importers and exporters, insurers, bankers (with their 
1 CONC own private currency), financiers, stock and station agents, commission 
1 CONC agents, mail contractors, general merchants - virtually everything.  They 
1 CONC sold anything from a reel of cotton over the counter to a shipload of 
1 CONC wool in London.  When they failed in 1862, brought down by outside 
1 CONC competitors who could not stand against 'Terrible Billy' on their own, 
1 CONC but in a combination contrived his downfall, the town suffered a blow 
1 CONC from which it is doubtful whether it ever really recovered.  
1 CONT
1 CONT At the very least, Belfast's progress was brought suddenly to a halt 
1 CONC which lasted until towns which barely existed when it was a virtual 
1 CONC metropolis, had out-stripped it in growth.  But the memories of former 
1 CONC greatness have given to the modern Port Fairy an atmosphere of lingering 
1 CONC romance which makes it unique among towns today." 
1 CONT
1 CONT RUTLEDGE, WILLIAM (1806-1876), merchant, banker and settler, was the 
1 CONC eldest son of James Rutledge, of Ballymagirl, near Bawnboy, County Cavan, 
1 CONC Ireland, and Martha, n�e Forster, of Longford. On reaching Sydney in the 
1 CONC Harriet in December 1829 Rutledge set up as a contractor for government 
1 CONC supplies, and after five years was assigned six convicts. In 1834 his 
1 CONC address was the Field of Mars, Parramatta, and later he acquired land at 
1 CONC Kissing Point and Eastwood. In 1837 he bought two blocks of 640 acres 
1 CONC (259 ha) on the Molonglo River near Queanbeyan. He gave evidence before 
1 CONC the select committee on the 1839 Squatting Act, and became a director of 
1 CONC the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney and a justice of the peace. After 
1 CONC establishing himself he brought out two sisters and four of his five 
1 CONC brothers: Thomas, who remained at Carwoola near Queanbeyan, Richard and 
1 CONC Lloyd who later went to Port Fairy, Victoria, and John who moved to 
1 CONC California.

1 CONT DEATH OF MR. WILLIAM RUTLEDGE, OF FARNHAM.
1 CONT
1 CONT By the death of Mr. William Rutledge, of Farnham, the intelligence of 
1 CONC which we received yesterday by telegraph from Warrnambool, the colony of 
1 CONC Victoria has lost another of its earliest pioneers. In the days when the 
1 CONC country was known as Port Phillip, Mr. Rutledge was a man of note in the 
1 CONC town of Belfast, then called Port Fairy, at that time such an 
1 CONC out-of-the-way place that a trip from Melbourne to the port was regarded 
1 CONC as an event of almost as much consequence as a voyage to England is now. 
1 CONC The iron-horse was then not even dreamt of, and Cobb and Co. were still 
1 CONC in America. The journey was almost invariably performed on horseback, and 
1 CONC the traveller could ride from Melbourne to Port Fairy and scarcely 
1 CONC encounter a single fence on the way. The bush tracks were few and 
1 CONC uncertain, and road- side inns very few and far between. It is by looking 
1 CONC back at the state of the colony at the time when Mr. Rutledge first 
1 CONC settled In Victoria that we are able to realise the wonderful advance in 
1 CONC civilisation that has since taken place. The career of Mr. Rutledge, 
1 CONC though unconnected with any great social or political movement, is still 
1 CONC interest- ing as exhibiting the value of indefati- gable energy, 
1 CONC indomitable courage, and thorough honesty in the development of a new 
1 CONC country. Mr. Rutledge, who had attained the ripe age of 70, was a native 
1 CONC of Ireland, and emigrated to Sydney about the year 1833, in company with 
1 CONC his uncle, Dr. Forster, formerly of the 1st Royals. For some time he 
1 CONC carried on the business of a contractor for the' supply of provisions to 
1 CONC the Go- vernment, which proved a financial success, He afterwards owned 
1 CONC some land near Parramatta, at a place called Kissing Point About 1839 he 
1 CONC married, and at the same time he purchased an estate called Molonglo, 
1 CONC near Queanbeyan. In 1840 he came to Victoria, and took up a block of land 
1 CONC of 5,120 acres, then called a special survey, near Kilmore. In 1846 he 
1 CONC visited Port Fairy, and there bought the business carried on by Mr. John 
1 CONC Cox. Next year, in company with one or two others, he took up the special 
1 CONC survey of Farnham, at that time covered with dense forest and scrub. The 
1 CONC business at Port Fairy became a very pros- perous one, and some years 
1 CONC after a branch was established in Warrnambool, At the time of the great 
1 CONC commercial depression in 1862, Mr, Rutledge's firm became em- barrassed, 
1 CONC and was forced to seek the pro- tection of the Insolvent Court. The 
1 CONC property of the firm was disposed of at a ruinous sacrifice; but Mr. 
1 CONC Rutledge, in conjunction with Mr. H. Woodward, was enabled to purchase 
1 CONC the landed estate from the mortgagees, Messrs. Flower, Salting, and Co., 
1 CONC London, and with careful management and returning good fortune they 
1 CONC succeeded in paying off the whole of the heavy liabilities.The 
1 CONC improvement of the pasture on the Farnham Estate, and the suitability of 
1 CONC the soil and climate for growing potatoes, mainly assisted in helping the 
1 CONC firm out of its difficulties. A few years ago Mr. Rutledge bought Mr. 
1 CONC Woodward's interest in the Farnham Estate and since then he has been sole 
1 CONC proprietor of this splendid property, for its extent the most fertile in 
1 CONC Australia.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge was a member of the Legisla- tive Assembly for Belfast in 
1 CONC the first Parlia- ment convened under the new Constitution Act. He did 
1 CONC not take a prominent part in the Assembly, although he was always atten- 
1 CONC tive to his duties in the House, and voted in nearly every division. This 
1 CONC Parliament was dissolved in 1859, and Mr. Rutledge did not seek 
1 CONC re-election. In the following year, how- ever, Mr. R. D. Ireland, then 
1 CONC member for Villiers and Heytesbury, was appointed At- torney-General of 
1 CONC the Heales Administra- tion, and in the ordinary course had to vacate his 
1 CONC seat He was opposed by Mr, Rutledge, who defeated him at the poll. It 
1 CONC subsequently appeared, however, that Mr, Rutledge's firm was interested 
1 CONC in a Govern- ment contract, and he was therefore not quali- fied to take 
1 CONC his seat. Mr. Ireland presented a petition against Mr. Rutledge's return, 
1 CONC Mr. Rutledge did not contest the matter, but resigned the seat. The 
1 CONC Assembly afterwards resolved that Mr, Rutledge was not duly elected, and 
1 CONC declared Mr. Ireland entitled to the seat Subsequent to that time Mr. 
1 CONC Rutledge took no active part in the politics of the colony.
1 CONT
1 CONT For a long time Mr. Rutledge's health had been failing, and during the 
1 CONC last three years he was unfortunate in being several times thrown from 
1 CONC vehicles, Of late his health became so feeble that all hope of his 
1 CONC recovery was abandoned. Latterly he was attacked with dropsy, and 
1 CONC yesterday morning he breathed his last He will be long remembered by old 
1 CONC residents in the Western district by the sobriquet which his hasty 
1 CONC disposition gained for him many years ago.

1 CONC The following was written by Norman in 2006
1 CONT
1 CONT Philibert Terrier Louat was a most unlucky man. He got his name from a 
1 CONC certain individul (Terrier) who agreed to take the lad as his godson and 
1 CONC make him his heir. He subsequntly went back to France and married. 
1 CONC Ownership of the Minchinbury vineyards went elsewhere.
1 CONT     He was apprenticed as a butcher and then as a dentist. I do not know 
1 CONC what he thought of the butcher business.  Dentistry made him feel sick.
1 CONT     He went for a time to be with Louis in Darwin and then in Cobar and 
1 CONC took up mining. Feeling the need for qulifications he then went to Waihii 
1 CONC in New Zealand.
1 CONT     He completed a course at the Waihii School of Mines and then went to 
1 CONC London hoping to sell an unbreakable crucible to Johson Mathey. They 
1 CONC turned him down on the not unreasonable grounds that they would only sell 
1 CONC one to each customer. At this time he also had a idea for an improved 
1 CONC tyre. He added iron particles to the rubber mixrure. The iron particles 
1 CONC increased the life of the tyre but the tyres got hot in use .
1 CONT     An adventurous soul, he travelled steerage class to London.
1 CONT     From London he went in 1906 to Sumatra. The place where he was, was 
1 CONC in the middle of tiger country. One attacked and took a coolie. The 
1 CONC Europeans organsed a hunt.  In the middle of the night Father sat in 
1 CONC clearing armed with a rifle. Saw nothing of any consequence. Moonlight 
1 CONC reflecting from leaves. He never said so but it must have been very 
1 CONC frightening 
1 CONT              He was forced out of Sumatra by a bout of dysentry malaria. 
1 CONC Similar to blackwater fever. Very bad.
1 CONT     Back in Australia he went to Inverell where he met and subsequently 
1 CONC married my mother They had two children who died in infancy. One 
1 CONC (Claudine) was strangled by the umbilical cord. The other, a boy (Leon), 
1 CONC lived for about two years and then died of tetanus. This was contracted, 
1 CONC via a dust storm and small lesion on his ear.
1 CONT     The parents then went to USA to join father's uncle, James (James 
1 CONC Josiah Rutledge). This was the wrong thing to do. He could have gone to 
1 CONC Fiji as manager of a gold mine which was still operating fifty years 
1 CONC later. On route Mother contracted the flu and they had to spend six 
1 CONC months under canvas in New Zealand.
1 CONT     In the USA they soon moved to Canada where I was born in Edmonton in 
1 CONC 1920.
1 CONT     They then chased small gold mines across Canada, where except for a  
1 CONC year or so in London seeking investors, we lived quite nicely for the 
1 CONC next nine years.  Then in response to my grandmother's plaintive calls, 
1 CONC we came back to Australia.  A year later we went up to Malaya where 
1 CONC father was managing a tin mine and dredge. The mine, which was called 
1 CONC Koondang was at a place called Rawong, 18 miles from Kuala Lumpur. Then 
1 CONC the depression.
1 CONT     For the rest of his life Father was involved in a series of 
1 CONC undercapitalised mines. Nearly all gold. Hard times. It was struggle for 
1 CONC them to put me through school.
1 CONT
1 CONT This text was then added by Sue James:-
1 CONT
1 CONT Terrier was invited by Agricultural Department NSW.  His brief was to 
1 CONC teach viticulture and viniculture to the early vignerons.  He may have 
1 CONC been at Minchinberry but he made his name in the Hunter Valley where he 
1 CONC built the Winery St. Helens.  He won international prizes for his wines.

1 CONC Joseph had been a teacher before he left England about June 1834 aboard 
1 CONC "Ellen" and travelled to Sydney via Hobart.  He arrived Sydney on 21 
1 CONC October 1834.
1 CONT
1 CONT A note from another source says "married at St Andrews Scotch 
1 CONC Church".this was in Bathurst St opposite St Andrews Cathedral.
1 CONT From 1842 to about 1877 they lived at "Granmore Cottage" Lot 6 Darling 
1 CONC Street, Balmain.
1 CONT
1 CONT Their children's births are recorded in the Baptist Church, Balmain. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Eliza Simpson, Sarah's sister married Henry Carter Perdriau. Henry and 
1 CONC Joseph formed Balmain Ferry Company in 1853.
1 CONT
1 CONT The following text was supplied by Sue James:-
1 CONT
1 CONT Joseph Hunt, born in London in 1816, arrived in Sydney via Hobart in 1824 
1 CONC (sic) on the ship "Ellen". There are only eleven passengers listed on 
1 CONC arrival in Sydney.  His, was the last name on the shipping list so it is 
1 CONC to be supposed that he came steerage.  The second last name is William 
1 CONC Newell who was to marry Sarah Hazell in 1838 and the two to be witnesses 
1 CONC to his marriage to Sarah Simpson in 1839.
1 CONT  
1 CONT Daisy, (Margaret Hunt), Joseph's granddaughter tells us in her notes that 
1 CONC he was educated at Westminster College where his father, Levett Hedding 
1 CONC Hunt was a Professor and went on to Cambridge University.  His 
1 CONC grandparents lived at Greenwich, so I feel the family always lived in or 
1 CONC around London.  Daisie also said that William Hollman Hunt, the 
1 CONC Pre-Raphaelite Artist of the famous religious painting "The Light of the 
1 CONC World", was a cousin of Joseph Hunt.  William Hollman Hunt was born in 
1 CONC London in 1827. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Daisy, when speaking of her grandfather said that he came to Sydney with 
1 CONC a classical education to be a tutor.  For whom, and where he lived in 
1 CONC those early years I cannot find. He may have lived on the harbour's north 
1 CONC shore. There are two clues, one is that his first wife Ann Callanan lived 
1 CONC at Lane Cove and another is a witness to his marriage to Sarah Simpson, 
1 CONC Catherine Manning.  Catherine may have been related to Eyde Manning, who 
1 CONC probably lived on the Lane Cove River.  Manning was one of the first 
1 CONC Parramatta to Sydney paddle steamer ferry operators taking over from the 
1 CONC watermen who rowed passengers the distance.  Catherine married James 
1 CONC Brown, boat builder in 1842 at St James Church Sydney.
1 CONT
1 CONT Joseph married Ann Callanan in September 1837 and seventeen months later 
1 CONC married Sarah Simpson.
1 CONT I cannot find a death notice for Ann but it appears she died, perhaps in 
1 CONC childbirth. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In February 1839 he then married Sarah Clarke Simpson, four months after 
1 CONC she arrived in the Colony from Newry, County Down, Ireland.
1 CONT Both weddings took place at St Andrews Scots Church, Presbyterian,  (now 
1 CONC demolished,) which was adjacent to St Andrews Anglican Cathedral by the 
1 CONC Rev. John McGarvie.  Joseph's signature on both marriage Certificates is 
1 CONC the same.  
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1841 Joseph bought Lot 6, of the subdivided, Granmore Grant Estate in 
1 CONC East Balmain.  It ran from Darling Road down the hill to Broadside Street 
1 CONC which runs along the shore. 
1 CONT
1 CONT The Leighhardt Historical Journal no. 14 tells us..'
1 CONT 'On the lower portion of the land he build a stone house "Granmore 
1 CONC Cottage" later altered to 2 Broadside St. 
1 CONT In 1844 Hunt built a weatherboard cottage (later demolished), close up to 
1 CONC the road at 134 Darling St, which he rented.  The Hunt family later built 
1 CONC two "shops and dwellings" ( later demolished) on the same site well 
1 CONC before 1886. In 1848 he bought lot 66 in Datchett Street which he later 
1 CONC sold to James Brown, boat builder, in 1852.  This James Brown was 
1 CONC probably the husband of Catherine Manning.
1 CONT                     *  *  *
1 CONT Hunt and his brother- in-law Henry Perdriau with Alexander Buchan formed 
1 CONC the Balmain Steam Ferry Co. in 1853 using the wharf and boat yard in 
1 CONC front of his house and Henry  Perdiau lived in Elgin cottage almost above 
1 CONC Grandmore cottage on Darling Road.   Perdriau was a pioneer steam ferry 
1 CONC master in Balmain, beginning in1840 but the depression of the early 
1 CONC forties prevented him from conducting regular services until 1844.'   
1 CONT
1 CONT Henry Perdriau was born in London in 1817, and arrived in the colony in 
1 CONC 1837.  The family were Huguenots who came to England in 1680s then to the 
1 CONC West Indies for some generations then back to England where they were 
1 CONC naval officers again for some generations.  Henry was grew up in Lambeth 
1 CONC Street Westminster, was educated at Greenwich Royal Hospital and entered 
1 CONC in to a naval career. Had Joseph and Henry known each other or the 
1 CONC families in London?  He married Sarah's sister Eliza Ann Simpson in 1844 
1 CONC and Alexander Buchan's sister Janet was to marry the sisters' younger 
1 CONC brother, Ebenezer Jr. in 1853. Sands directory notes Ebenizer as a ferry 
1 CONC owner so he must have been involved too. For a while it was truly a 
1 CONC family affair.  Henry was to buy-out both Joseph and Alexander's shares 
1 CONC in the company some time later.  After Alexander Buchan died in 1859 and 
1 CONC the company was in the name Predriau and Hunt for some years.  Henry 
1 CONC Perdriau and his sons was to operate the company till 1881..
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1855 Joseph made his will and called himself a "Landowner".  It 
1 CONC appears that he owned a number of properties, definitely one in Johnston 
1 CONC Street but I have not been able to find them all.  He left these 
1 CONC properties in trust for the maintenance of his wife Sarah. 
1 CONT   
1 CONT The Leichhardt Historical Journal further tells us...
1 CONT 'Hunt was a public spirited man being secretary of the Australian Union 
1 CONC Benefit Society in 1839.  In January 1842 he was the collector and agent 
1 CONC for the Sydney Morning Herald in the Balmain district.  His civic 
1 CONC mindedness came to the fore when he called a public meeting at the 
1 CONC Captain Cook Hotel (Captain Nicholson's former Durham House in Nicholson 
1 CONC Street) in July 1842 to discuss improvements to the ferry stairs at the 
1 CONC foot of Darling Street and repairs to the road.  He may have also been 
1 CONC instrumental for the building of the "Pyrmont Ferry Wharf" at the foot of 
1 CONC Killeen Street. This wharf made the houses on the Granmore Estate more 
1 CONC accessible because road travel was extremely difficult.
1 CONT
1 CONT Although much of Hunt's life was spent cooped up as a "writing clerk" his 
1 CONC great love was the sea.  His small boat Alexander was listed as No. 12 in 
1 CONC the '1843 Register of British Ships.' I presume this register was for 
1 CONC ships in Sydney.
1 CONT
1 CONT Daisie said that after arriving in the colony Joseph decided that the 
1 CONC future lay in commerce and he opened a boot factory.  In 1858-9 Sands 
1 CONC Directory, B Cocks & Joseph Hunt, Bookmakers, 369 George St, Sydney is 
1 CONC noted. This is the only direct connection with boot making in his name 
1 CONC that I have found. Sarah's father Ebenezer Simpson Sr, Joseph's 
1 CONC father-in-law noted his occupation as "carrier" when he arrived In 1838, 
1 CONC but by the early 1840s he is operating a tannery  at Camden.
1 CONT This business was inherited by his son Ebenezer in 1855 when he died.  
1 CONC Daisie's  father John Hedding Hunt had a Shoe Emporium and Bootmakers 
1 CONC shop on Darling Road Balmain and a number of his brothers appear to have 
1 CONC been involved with leather goods.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Leichhardt Historical Journal...
1 CONT After a stroke that left him paralysed for him four years, Hunt died at 
1 CONC Granmore Cottage on 3rd September 1870, aged 54.  His widow, Sarah lived 
1 CONC on at the cottage until her death on 4th October, 1887 at 67.

1 CONC marriage to Sarah Simpson in 1839.
1 CONT  
1 CONT Daisy, (Margaret Hunt),Joseph's granddaughter tells us in her notes that 
1 CONC he was educated at Westminster College where his father, Levett Hedding 
1 CONC Hunt was a Professor and went on to Cambridge University.  His 
1 CONC grandparents lived at Greenwich, so I feel the family always lived in or 
1 CONC around London.  Daisy also said that William Hollman Hunt, the 
1 CONC Pre-Raphaelite Artist of the famous religious painting "The Light of the 
1 CONC World", was a cousin of Joseph Hunt.  William Hollman Hunt was born in 
1 CONC London in 1827. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Daisy, when speaking of her grandfather said that he came to Sydney with 
1 CONC a classical education to be a tutor.  I can't find where he lived in 
1 CONC those early years. He may have lived on the harbour's north shore. There 
1 CONC are two clues, one is that his first wife Ann Callanan lived at Lane Cove 
1 CONC and another is a witness to his marriage to Sarah Simpson, Catherine 
1 CONC Manning.  Catherine may have been related to Eyde Manning, who probably 
1 CONC lived on the Lane Cove River.  Manning was one of the first Parramatta to 
1 CONC Sydney paddle steamer ferry operators, taking over from the watermen who 
1 CONC rowed passengers the distance.  Catherine married James Brown, boat 
1 CONC builder in 1842 at St James Church Sydney.
1 CONT
1 CONT Joseph married Ann Callanan in September 1837 and seventeen months later 
1 CONC married Sarah Simpson. I cannot find a death notice for Ann but it 
1 CONC appears she died, perhaps in child birth. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In February, 1839 he then married Sarah Clarke Simpson, fourteen months 
1 CONC after she arrived in the Colony from Newry, County Down, Ireland.
1 CONT Both weddings took place at St Andrews Scots Church, Presbyterian, (now 
1 CONC demolished,) which was adjacent to St Andrews Anglican Cathedral, by the 
1 CONC Rev. John McGarvie.  Joseph's signature on both marriage Certificates is 
1 CONC the same.  
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1841 Joseph bought Lot 6, of the subdivided, Granmore Grant Estate in 
1 CONC East Balmain.  It ran from Darling Road down the hill to Broadside Street 
1 CONC which runs overlooks the shore line. 
1 CONT
1 CONT The 'Leichhardt Historical Journal No. 14':
1 CONT 'On the lower portion of the land he built a stone house "Granmore 
1 CONC Cottage" later altered to 2 Broadside St. 
1 CONT In 1844 Hunt built a weatherboard cottage (later demolished), close up to 
1 CONC the road at 134 Darling St, which he rented.  The Hunt family later built 
1 CONC two shops and dwellings, (later demolished), on the same site well before 
1 CONC 1886. In 1848 he bought lot 66 in Datchett Street which he later sold to 
1 CONC James Brown, boat builder, in 1852.  This James Brown was probably the 
1 CONC husband of Catherine Manning.
1 CONT
1 CONT In this home Joseph and Sarah brought up and educated thirteen children 
1 CONC to adulthood, one child died in infancy.
1 CONT                     *  *  *
1 CONT Joseph Hunt and his brother in law Henry Perdriau, with Alexander Buchan, 
1 CONC formed the Balmain Steam Ferry Co. in 1853, using the wharf and boat yard 
1 CONC in front of his house to moor the ferries.  Henry Perdriau lived in Elgin 
1 CONC cottage,  above Granmore cottage, on Darling Road.   Perdriau was a 
1 CONC pioneer steam ferry master in Balmain, he began running ferries in1840, 
1 CONC but the depression of the early fortie, prevented him from conducting 
1 CONC regular services.  In 1844, he built a new ferry, with a steam driven 
1 CONC paddlewheel, and called it "Waterman" after the watermen, who until then 
1 CONC had rowed people about the harbour.   
1 CONT
1 CONT Henry Perdriau was born in London in 1817, and arrived in the colony in 
1 CONC 1837.  The family were Huguenots who came to England in 1680s then to the 
1 CONC West Indies for some generations then back to England where they were 
1 CONC naval officers again for some generations.  Henry grew up in Lambeth 
1 CONC Street Westminster, was educated at Greenwich Royal Hospital and entered 
1 CONC in to a naval career. Had Joseph and Henry or the families known each 
1 CONC other in London?  He married Sarah's sister Eliza Ann Simpson in 1844 and 
1 CONC Alexander Buchan's sister Janet was to marry the sisters' younger 
1 CONC brother, Ebenezer Jr. in 1853. Sands directory notes Ebenezer as a ferry 
1 CONC owner so he may have been involved too. After Alexander Buchan died, in 
1 CONC 1859, the company was in the name Predriau and Hunt for some years.  Then 
1 CONC Henry may have bought out Joseph. Henry Perdriau and his sons operated 
1 CONC the company till 1881.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1855 Joseph made his will and called himself a "Landowner".  It 
1 CONC appears that he owned a number of properties, definitely one in Johnston 
1 CONC Street and another in Datchett Street, but I have not been able to find 
1 CONC them all.  He left these properties in trust for the maintenance of his 
1 CONC wife Sarah. 
1 CONT   
1 CONT The 'Leichhardt Historical Journal', further informs us:
1 CONT 'Hunt was a public spirited man being secretary of the Australian Union 
1 CONC Benefit Society in 1839.  In January 1842 he was the collector and agent 
1 CONC for the Sydney Morning Herald in the Balmain district.  His civic 
1 CONC mindedness came to the fore when he called a public meeting at the 
1 CONC Captain Cook Hotel (Captain Nicholson's former Durham House in Nicholson 
1 CONC Street) in July 1842 to discuss improvements to the ferry stairs at the 
1 CONC foot of Darling Street and repairs to the road.  He supported the 
1 CONC establishment of the School of Art and a Library. He may have also been 
1 CONC instrumental for the building of the "Pyrmont Ferry Wharf" at the foot of 
1 CONC Killeen Street. This wharf made the houses on the Granmore Estate more 
1 CONC accessible because road travel was extremely difficult.
1 CONT
1 CONT Although much of Hunt's life was spent cooped up as a "writing clerk" his 
1 CONC great love was the sea.  His small boat Alexander was listed as No. 12 in 
1 CONC the '1843 Register of British Ships, Sydney'. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Daisy said, that after arriving in the colony Joseph decided that the 
1 CONC future lay in commerce and he opened a boot factory.  In 1858-9 Sands 
1 CONC Directory, B Cocks & Joseph Hunt, Bookmakers, 369 George St, Sydney is 
1 CONC noted. This is the only direct connection with boot making, in his name, 
1 CONC that I have found. Sarah's father, Ebenezer Simpson Snr, Joseph's father 
1 CONC in law noted his occupation as "carrier" when he arrived In 1838, but by 
1 CONC the early 1840s he is operating a tannery at Camden.
1 CONT This business was inherited, by his son Ebenezer in 1855, when he died.  
1 CONC Daisy's  father, John Hedding Hunt had a Shoe Emporium and Boot Makers 
1 CONC shop on Darling Road Balmain and a number of his brothers appear to have 
1 CONC been involved with leather goods.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Leichhardt Historical Journal...
1 CONT 'After a stroke that left him paralyzed for four years, Hunt died at 
1 CONC Granmore Cottage on 3rd September 1870, aged 54.  His widow, Sarah lived 
1 CONC on at the cottage until her death on 4th October, 1887 at 67.'

1 CONC Elizabeth (Betty or Sarah) nee Dixon was convicted on 6th March 1790 "on 
1 CONC suspicion of aiding and assisting in breaking open a dwelling and 
1 CONC stealing five cheeses and sundry other articles" and was sentenced to 
1 CONC seven years transportation.  She sailed from England on the "Mary Anne" 
1 CONC on 25th February 1791 and arrived at Port Jackson (Sydney) on 9 July 
1 CONC 1791.  A liason with a ship's officer, James Wilson resulted in a 
1 CONC pregnancy with Sarah.
1 CONT
1 CONT In the colony she served her convict sentence as a housekeeper to Edward 
1 CONC Field.
1 CONT
1 CONT She is buried in the old Castlereagh Parish Burial Ground.
1 CONT __________________________________________________________________________
1 CONC ______________________________________
1 CONT The following is research by Sue James:-
1 CONT
1 CONT Betty Elizabeth Sarah - (Dixon) Mitchell Field
1 CONT Who was she?
1 CONT
1 CONT When I first heard about her I was fascinated. 
1 CONT What a difficult and hard life she had!
1 CONT What courage and strength she had!
1 CONT What a great achievement in life she had!  
1 CONT
1 CONT We know so little about Elizabeth Mitchell's life before she arrived in 
1 CONC the early Colony of New South Wales.  All English records pre-1791 refer 
1 CONC her to as Betty and as Betty is how I think of her.  She was born in 
1 CONC approximately 1869-70, was probably brought up in poor circumstances and 
1 CONC was illiterate.  I have an in-law who lives within miles of Trowbridge, 
1 CONC now the county seat of Wiltshire, where as far as we know, her story 
1 CONC begins.  This has allowed me to spend hours reading through parish 
1 CONC registers for births deaths and marriages, the poor law lists, 
1 CONC apprenticeship lists and lists of people moved on from town after the 
1 CONC 'Enclosure Acts'.  (The Enclosures Acts of the 18th Century forced the 
1 CONC fencing of the village commons where landless people could no longer 
1 CONC graze their cow pig or few sheep).  I also obtained the services of a 
1 CONC researcher however, all this was to no avail.  I cannot identify Betty 
1 CONC with any combination of her possible names or connections with a Sarah 
1 CONC and Mary Mitchell. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Some Field family members believe she was married early and her maiden 
1 CONC name was Dixon.  However, neither the IGI nor the above registers show 
1 CONC any marriages between the names Dixon and Mitchell (either way) anywhere 
1 CONC in the south of England during the 1780s. 
1 CONT Perhaps she was not formally married? My researcher tells me that after 
1 CONC Hardwicke's Marriage Act of 1753 better records were kept and marriage 
1 CONC became less expensive for the poor.  The Commissioners for the Poor 
1 CONC ensured that couples cohabitating were married.  This was so they could 
1 CONC keep track of the moving population and especially to find the parents of 
1 CONC any abandoned children.  If Betty had married or had a liaison it is 
1 CONC likely she would have had children by the age of twenty when she was 
1 CONC arrested.
1 CONT
1 CONT What do we definitely know about Betty?
1 CONT
1 CONT The Salisbury and Wiltshire Journal, 6th Jan, and repeated 8th March 1790 
1 CONC tells us that Betty Mitchell was arrested on the 1st January, 1790 and 
1 CONC charged with:-   
1 CONT . . . "burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling house of John 
1 CONC Helps in the parish of Trowbridge about one in the morning of 30th Dec. 
1 CONC last and stealing thereout five cheeses and other goods val. 30 shillings 
1 CONC & 6d". 
1 CONT
1 CONT She was then taken to Fisherton Anger Goal outside New Sarum (Salisbury) 
1 CONC the then country seat of Wiltshire.
1 CONT
1 CONT At the same time Sarah Mitchell was arrested and charged with:-
1 CONT . . . "feloniously receiving five cheeses and one pair of cotton gloves 
1 CONC parcel and p.  Knowing the same to be stolen.  
1 CONT Sarah was taken to the Bridewell at Devises".
1 CONT
1 CONT Mary Mitchell with:-. . . "house breaking". 
1 CONT There is no evidence that Mary was imprisoned.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Salisbury & Wiltshire Journal, 15th March 1790 in its 'Report of the 
1 CONC Lent Assizes' tells us:-
1 CONT ..."Betty Mitchell for assisting in breaking open the dwelling house of 
1 CONC John Helps of Studley and stealing five cheeses and other articles..." 
1 CONC guilty"... "Sentence: to be transported for seven year".   (Note the word 
1 CONC assisting).
1 CONT Sarah and Mary Mitchell acquitted.  Discharged.
1 CONT
1 CONT From the Report of the "Wilts Lent Circuit 1779 - 30th Geo:3."
1 CONT ..."Betty Mitchell:  guilty of stealing the goods - not guilty of 
1 CONC breaking and entering the house in the night.
1 CONT Sentence: to be transported beyond the seas for the term of seven years. 
1 CONT
1 CONT "Sarah Mitchell: not guilty of feloniously receiving (goods) knowing the 
1 CONC same to be stolen.         Discharged".
1 CONT
1 CONT "Mary Mitchell:  being admitted evidences let (her) be discharged".
1 CONT
1 CONT Witnesses: Betty Mitchell, John Helps William Smith and Elizabeth Helps.
1 CONT Witnesses: Mary Mitchell, John Helps and Thomas Beverstock. 
1 CONT
1 CONT It appears that Mary gave evidence against Betty and then Betty took the 
1 CONC full punishment for the crime. In 1790, theft to the value of thirty 
1 CONC shillings (30/-) was a capital offence.  So I believe Betty was very 
1 CONC lucky that she did not receive the death sentence or fourteen years 
1 CONC transportation.
1 CONT
1 CONT (At the same Assizes three men received death sentences. One for stealing 
1 CONC a gelding the second for breaking and entering and stealing diverse 
1 CONC articles and the third for stealing two sheep - luckily they were all 
1 CONC reprieved.  Their Honours the judges,  Sir Beaumont Hotham and  Sir 
1 CONC Richard Penryn must have felt lenient that day.  It is interesting to 
1 CONC note that two men charged with murder were found guilty of manslaughter, 
1 CONC fined one shilling and released.  Property was more important than life.)
1 CONT
1 CONT The quarterly 'Calendar of returns for Fisherton Anger Goal' shows Betty 
1 CONC Mitchell was imprisoned at Fisherton Anger Gaol in June, September and 
1 CONC December 1790.  She does not appear in the Calendar again and this would 
1 CONC mean she was removed to London to board the ship 'Mary Anne' for 
1 CONC transportation to New South Wales leaving in February 1791.
1 CONT
1 CONT What do we know about the district where the crime took place?
1 CONT
1 CONT Trowbridge is in the west of Wiltshire just east of Dorset and Somerset. 
1 CONC These counties were famous for their sheep and wool.  In the 1780s 
1 CONC Trowbridge was a fast growing town with well established broadloom 
1 CONC weaving and fulling (felting) cottage industries.  Within twenty years 
1 CONC large weaving factories were built, taking the town into the industrial 
1 CONC era.  In the town and villages in the district there were a large number 
1 CONC of Nonconformist and Low Church protestant religious practices.
1 CONT
1 CONT Studley, now a locality within the greater town of Trowbridge, was a 
1 CONC village outside the town.  It had a single street of stone houses.  Each 
1 CONC house had two rooms up and two rooms down and an attic in the roof which 
1 CONC was reached by a ladder.  It was in the attic that the man of the house 
1 CONC set up his broadloom and spent his days using both hands and feet to 
1 CONC weave his beautiful wool fabrics.  This village backed onto lush farming 
1 CONC land which would have supported large farms running sheep and dairy 
1 CONC cattle.
1 CONT
1 CONT Who were the Mitchell women? 
1 CONT
1 CONT The Mitchell women could have been part of the itinerant poor who came 
1 CONC into the towns after the Enclosures Act when landless people had to 
1 CONC scavenge a living off the countryside.  They may have belonged to a 
1 CONC broadloom weaver's family or been dairy maids at a farm.
1 CONT
1 CONT Who was John Helps?  
1 CONT
1 CONT In my research I found a John Helps who had been apprenticed as a 
1 CONC broadloom weaver in 1775.  If this was our John Helps, in 1789 he would 
1 CONC have been be a Master Weaver.  He could have set up a household in 
1 CONC Studley, however, he would have not been a wealthy man.  I have been 
1 CONC informed that Wiltshire cheese in 1789 was a hard cheese made into a wide 
1 CONC flat wheel shape approximately two feet in diameter and two to three 
1 CONC inches thick.  Each one is quite heavy and one woman would not be able to 
1 CONC carry five, plus other articles.  I think it is unlikely that a broadloom 
1 CONC weaver would have five of these cheeses in his house and it is more 
1 CONC likely that John Helps was a farmer, with a number of servants, who were 
1 CONC later to be witnesses at the trial.  Betty may have been one of these 
1 CONC servants (a milkmaid perhaps) as it would appear that she knew the layout 
1 CONC of the house for her and Mary to enter it in the dark at one in the 
1 CONC morning.  It is interesting to remember that she was acquitted of 
1 CONC 'assisting breaking and entering' and convicted of 'stealing'.
1 CONT
1 CONT I feel that Betty was a strong and courageous woman living a difficult 
1 CONC life.  Her family must have been in dire straits for them to risk 
1 CONC stealing something so hard to hide as five large cheeses.  She took the 
1 CONC punishment for the theft and was sent away from her family for ever.  Did 
1 CONC they visit her in Fisherton Anger goal to say goodbye before leaving for 
1 CONC London and New South Wales?  Whether they did or not she found the 
1 CONC stamina to survive the long voyage to New South Wales in appalling 
1 CONC conditions. She then arrived in July 1791, in the middle of winter to a 
1 CONC land with flimsy shelter, the population half starved and subject to 
1 CONC harsh discipline.  
1 CONT
1 CONT It appears that she turned to James Wilson, a ship's officer for 
1 CONC protection and within a year gave birth to a daughter.  On the birth 
1 CONC certificate she called herself Sarah Mitchell and she also called her 
1 CONC daughter Sarah.  Then, when her first child with Edward Field was born 
1 CONC she called that daughter Mary Anne and again when Edward Field junior was 
1 CONC born she called herself Sarah Mitchell.  The names Sarah and Mary were 
1 CONC very important to her and this is why I wonder about her marriage into 
1 CONC the Mitchell family.  Would she have felt the same if they were her 
1 CONC in-laws?
1 CONT
1 CONT Betty's country background would have made her an ideal farmer's wife to 
1 CONC Edward Field and if she had been a maid who worked with cattle and had 
1 CONC cowpox she may have avoided the pock marks from smallpox that many female 
1 CONC convicts were described as having by contemporary writers.  
1 CONT
1 CONT We know little of Betty - Elizabeth - Sarah's first few years of life in 
1 CONC the colony. When did she and Edward first meet? They must have been 
1 CONC together by 1793.  Mary Anne, Edward's daughter was born in 1794.  Was 
1 CONC she his assigned servant? Did she live on his land grant of twenty five 
1 CONC acres in the present Five Dock area?  Or, did she live near Army Barracks 
1 CONC in Sydney, Parramatta or the Hawkesbury?  Edward left the army in 1801 
1 CONC and they were probably living at Castlereagh before 1803 when Edward's 
1 CONC land grant was gazetted.  The Low Church religions practiced in the 
1 CONC locality of her early years would have made it easy for her to join the 
1 CONC newly established Methodist community at Castlereagh some years later. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Being sent to New South Wales may at first appear catastrophic, but later 
1 CONC it can be seen as fortunate for Betty.  At the end of her life she had 
1 CONC achieved a comfortable home and I think the love and respect of a large, 
1 CONC educated and prospering family.  This may not have happened if she had 
1 CONC stayed in England.
1 CONT
1 CONT I would love to know if she was known as Betty, Elizabeth or Sarah to, 
1 CONC her family and friends in the colony.

1 CONC further information from readers.

1 CONT In his on-the-spot account of life in the early years of the colony and 
1 CONC now in a highly regarded book, "1788", Watkin Tench writes:-
1 CONT "The distressful state of the colony for provisions continued gradually 
1 CONC to augment until the 9th of July, when the Mary Anne transport arrived 
1 CONC from England. This ship had sailed from the Downs so lately as the 25th 
1 CONC February, having been only four months and twelve days on her passage. 
1 CONC She brought out convicts, by contract, at a specific sum for each person. 
1 CONC But to demonstrate the effect of humanity and justice, of 144 female 
1 CONC convicts embarked on board only three had died, and the rest had landed 
1 CONC in perfect health, all loud in praise of their conductor. The master's 
1 CONC name was Munro: and his ship, after fulfilling her engagement with 
1 CONC government, was bound on the southern fishery. The reader must not 
1 CONC conclude that I sacrifice to dull detail, when he finds such benevolent 
1 CONC conduct minutely narrated. The advocates of humanity are not yet become 
1 CONC too numerous; but those who practise its divine precepts, however humble 
1 CONC and unnoticed be their station, ought not to sink into obscurity, 
1 CONC unrecorded and unpraised, with the vile monsters who deride misery and 
1 CONC fatten on calamity".

1 CONT Notes written by Sue James in August 2006
1 CONT
1 CONT Betty Elizabeth Sarah - (Dixon) Mitchell Field
1 CONT Who was she?
1 CONT
1 CONT When I first heard about her I was fascinated. 
1 CONT What a difficult and hard life she had!
1 CONT What courage and strength she had!
1 CONT What a great achievement in life she had!  
1 CONT
1 CONT We know so little about Elizabeth Mitchell's life before she arrived in 
1 CONC the early Colony of New South Wales.  All English records pre-1791 refer 
1 CONC her to as Betty and as Betty is how I think of her.  She was born in 
1 CONC approximately 1869-70, was probably brought up in poor circumstances and 
1 CONC was illiterate.  I have an in-law who lives within miles of Trowbridge, 
1 CONC now the county seat of Wiltshire, where as far as we know, her story 
1 CONC begins.  This has allowed me to spend hours reading through parish 
1 CONC registers for births deaths and marriages, the poor law lists, 
1 CONC apprenticeship lists and lists of people moved on from town after the 
1 CONC 'Enclosure Acts'.  (The Enclosures Acts of the 18th Century forced the 
1 CONC fencing of the village commons where landless people could no longer 
1 CONC graze their cow pig or few sheep.)  I also obtained the services of a 
1 CONC researcher however, all this was to no avail.  I cannot identify Betty 
1 CONC with any combination of her possible names or connections with a Sarah 
1 CONC and Mary Mitchell. 
1 CONT Some Field family members believe she was married early and her maiden 
1 CONC name was Dixon.  However, neither the IGI nor the above registers show 
1 CONC any marriages between the names Dixon and Mitchell (either way) anywhere 
1 CONC in the south of England during the 1780s. 
1 CONT Perhaps she was not formally married? My researcher tells me that after 
1 CONC Hardwicke's Marriage Act of 1753 better records were kept and marriage 
1 CONC became less expensive for the poor.  The Commissioners for the Poor 
1 CONC ensured that couples cohabitating were married.  This was so they could 
1 CONC keep track of the moving population and especially to find the parents of 
1 CONC any abandoned children.  If Betty had married or had a liaison it is 
1 CONC likely she would have had children by the age of twenty when she was 
1 CONC arrested.
1 CONT
1 CONT What do we definitely know about Betty?
1 CONT
1 CONT The Salisbury and Wiltshire Journal, 6th Jan, and repeated 8th March 1790 
1 CONC tells us that
1 CONT Betty Mitchell was arrested on the 1st January, 1790 and charged with:-   
1 CONT . . . burglariously breaking and entering the dwelling house of John 
1 CONC Helps in the parish of Trowbridge about one in the morning of 30th Dec. 
1 CONC last and stealing thereout five cheeses and other goods val. 30 shillings 
1 CONC & 6d. 
1 CONT She was then taken to Fisherton Anger Goal outside New Sarum (Salisbury) 
1 CONC the then country seat of Wiltshire.
1 CONT
1 CONT At the same time Sarah Mitchell was arrested and charged with:-
1 CONT . . . feloniously receiving five cheeses and one pair of cotton gloves 
1 CONC parcel and p.  Knowing the same to be stolen.  
1 CONT Sarah was taken to the Bridewell at Devises.
1 CONT
1 CONT Mary Mitchell with:-. . . house breaking. 
1 CONT There is no evidence that Mary was imprisoned.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Salisbury & Wiltshire Journal, 15thMarch 1790 in its 'Report of the 
1 CONC Lent Assizes' tells us:-
1 CONT �Betty Mitchell for assisting in breaking open the dwelling house of John 
1 CONC Helps of Studley and stealing five cheeses and other articles   �   
1 CONC guilty   
1 CONT    sentenced: to be transported for seven year.   Note the word assisting.
1 CONT Sarah and Mary Mitchell acquitted.  Discharged.
1 CONT
1 CONT From the Report of the "Wilts Lent Circuit 1779 - 30th Geo:3."
1 CONT �
1 CONT Betty Mitchell:          guilty of      stealing the goods - 
1 CONT          not guilty of   breaking and entering the house in the night.
1 CONT Sentence:          to be transported beyond the seas for the term of 
1 CONC seven years. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Sarah Mitchell:        not guilty of       feloniously receiving (goods) 
1 CONC knowing the 
1 CONT                       same to be stolen.         Discharged.
1 CONT
1 CONT Mary Mitchell:         being admitted evidences let (her) be discharged.
1 CONT
1 CONT Witnesses:      Betty Mitchell         John Helps William Smith and 
1 CONC Elizabeth Helps.
1 CONT Witnesses:        Mary Mitchell        John Helps and Thomas Beverstock. 
1 CONT
1 CONT It appears that Mary gave evidence against Betty and then Betty took the 
1 CONC full punishment for the crime. In 1790, theft to the value of thirty 
1 CONC shillings, 30/- was a capital offence.  So I believe Betty was very lucky 
1 CONC that she did not receive the death sentence or fourteen years 
1 CONC transportation.
1 CONT
1 CONT (At the same Assizes three men received death sentences. One for stealing 
1 CONC a gelding the second for breaking and entering and stealing diverse 
1 CONC articles and the third for stealing two sheep - luckily they were all 
1 CONC reprieved.  Their Honours the judges,  Sir Beaumont Hotham and  Sir 
1 CONC Richard Penryn must have felt lenient that day.  It is interesting to 
1 CONC note that two men charged with murder were found guilty of manslaughter, 
1 CONC fined one shilling and released.  Property was more important than life.)
1 CONT
1 CONT The quarterly 'Calendar of returns for Fisherton Anger Goal' shows Betty 
1 CONC Mitchell was imprisoned at Fisherton Anger Goal in June, September and 
1 CONC December 1790.  She does not appear in the Calendar again and this would 
1 CONC mean she was removed to London to board the ship 'Mary Ann' for 
1 CONC transportation to New South Wales leaving in January 1791.
1 CONT
1 CONT What do we know about where the crime took place?
1 CONT
1 CONT Trowbridge is in the west of Wiltshire just east of Dorset and Summerset. 
1 CONC These  counties were famous for their sheep and wool.  In the 1780s 
1 CONC Trowbridge was a fast growing town with well established broadloom 
1 CONC weaving and fulling (felting) cottage industries.  Within twenty years 
1 CONC large weaving factories were built taking the town into the industrial 
1 CONC era.  In the town and villages in the district there were a large number 
1 CONC of Nonconformist and Low Church protestant religious practices.
1 CONT
1 CONT Studley, now a locality within the greater town of Trowbridge, was a 
1 CONC village outside the town.  It had a single street of stone houses.  Each 
1 CONC house had two rooms up and two rooms down and an attic in the roof which 
1 CONC was reached by a ladder.  It was in the attic that the man of the house 
1 CONC set up his broadloom and spent his days using both hands and feet to 
1 CONC weave his beautiful wool fabrics.  This village backed onto lush farming 
1 CONC land which would have supported large farms running sheep and dairy 
1 CONC cattle.
1 CONT
1 CONT Who were the Mitchell women? 
1 CONT
1 CONT The Mitchell women could have been part of the itinerant poor who came 
1 CONC into the towns after the Enclosures Act when landless people had to 
1 CONC scavenge a living off the countryside.  They may have belonged to a 
1 CONC broadloom weaver's family or been dairy maids at a farm.
1 CONT
1 CONT Who was John Helps?  
1 CONT

1 CONC Rev. Stephen Rabone, was a well known Wesleyan clergyman and missionary 
1 CONC in Tonga.  Stephen and Eliza had a strong call to ministry to travel from 
1 CONC their native England to Tonga where Eliza's brother had been since 1826. 
1 CONC Their determination must indeed have been strong because getting there 
1 CONC would have turned away the weaker willed.
1 CONT
1 CONT They sailed from England on "Sir Thomas Munro" on Wednesday 10th December 
1 CONC 1834 and while passing Cape Verde they were shipwrecked on Bona Vista 
1 CONC Island. They lost everything except their lives and had to spend six 
1 CONC weeks on the small island before they could get a ship back to England.  
1 CONC They arrived in Plymouth on Thursday 12th February 1835 feeling that they 
1 CONC had made absolutely no progress in their quest.
1 CONT
1 CONT Filled with determination they sailed again from Greenwich on Thursday 
1 CONC 16th April 1835 on board the "Rubicon".  This ship would take them only 
1 CONC on the first leg of this trip as far as Hobart Town, Van Diemans Land 
1 CONC (Tasmania).  Stephen's diary of the trip tells of the horror of spending 
1 CONC nineteen weeks at sea with progress on many days being little or none due 
1 CONC to the unsatisfactory winds.
1 CONT
1 CONT The trip was terribly rough on much of the trip and Stephen writes that 
1 CONC many nights were "miserable and wretchedly uncomfortable".  But if he had 
1 CONC a problem it would have been no better for Eliza who was three months 
1 CONC pregnant when they sailed and must surely have wondered if they would 
1 CONC make Hobart Town before the birth of her baby.
1 CONT
1 CONT On one day Stephen wrote "Very little done today; my Eliza got a slight 
1 CONC fall this morning and sick most of the day.  The wind is now a little 
1 CONC fairer, O may it continue.  I hold my journal on my knee, sit against the 
1 CONC side of ye bed and hold ye candle".  On Wednesday 26th August 1835, upon 
1 CONC sighting Van Diemans Land after 124 days at sea, Stephen says simply 
1 CONC "Praise the Lord forever".
1 CONT
1 CONT But this was only the first leg of the trip and after waiting in Hobart 
1 CONC for the birth of the baby, a ship to Sydney and another to Vavau, Tonga 
1 CONC they finally completed the journey on Wednesday 15th June 1836.  They 
1 CONC stayed in Tonga as missionaries for many years.

1 CONT An extract from The Centenary of Newington College 1863-1963 published by 
1 CONC Halstead Press Sydney 1963.
1 CONT
1 CONT "In the archives of Newington College there have fortunately survived 
1 CONC early
1 CONT Methodist Education Committee documents, which predate the foundation of
1 CONT the college and which show only too clearly the gravity of the problems
1 CONT which faced the Commiteee, under its able Chairman, the Reverend Stephen
1 CONT Rabone, in the 1850s.  ...
1 CONT
1 CONT Without the encouragement and support of Stephen Rabone and his Committee,
1 CONT it is doubtful if anything would have come of John Manton's proposals.  
1 CONC His
1 CONT dream of a "Collegiate Institution" would probably never have materialised
1 CONT if the capable, practical and influential Rabone had not backed him.  As
1 CONT early as 2nd December 1861,  ... and long before it was officially 
1 CONC approved
1 CONT by the Methodist Conference, the Committee had set the machinery in motion
1 CONT to set up a college.
1 CONT ... Stephen Rabone busy with his translations of the scriputures into the
1 CONT Tongan language, ...
1 CONT ...It was as well that he [Manton] had such allies to help him push 
1 CONC through
1 CONT his plans for a 'Collegiate Institution'.  Although Stephen Rabone's
1 CONT Christian Advocate and Wesleyen Record  had run into financial 
1 CONC difficulties
1 CONT soon after 1858 and ceased publication in 1861, it steadfastly and
1 CONT ceaslessly stressed the need for highter education facilities during these
1 CONT three vital years. At the same time, in their sermons, their conversations
1 CONT and their speeches at district meetings and conferences, Manton and the
1 CONT rest kept the idea alive.

1 CONT
1 CONT The first is from James Rutledge 1817-1899, who wrote in his diary "I 
1 CONC came of a decent Methodist family in Ireland, said to be descendants of 
1 CONC those Puritans who accompanied Oliver Cromwell when that great and good 
1 CONC man came over to suppress the rebellions and stop the persecutins of the

1 CONC Rutledge family members to North America and adds, "My father's family 
1 CONC were of the same descent, being among the number on whom Cromwell settled 
1 CONC some of the confiscasted estates in the west of Ireland.
1 CONT
1 CONT The second reference is contained in the biographies of John Rutledge and 
1 CONC his brother Edward Rutledge contained in the book, "John and Edward 
1 CONC Rutledge of South Carolina" by James Haw, In it the author writes, 
1 CONC "Little is known of John and Edward Rutledge's European ancestry. Their 
1 CONC father's family was apparently of English origin [referring to the border 
1 CONC region of England and Scotland] The direct forebears of South Carolina's

1 CONC John II was elected to the Commons House of Assembly of His Majesty's 
1 CONC Province of South Carolina at the age of 21 on 14 March 1761.  He became 
1 CONC Attorney-General in May 1764. The date of death accordinbg to th SC 
1 CONC Historical & Genealogical Magazine is 18 July 1800.
1 CONT
1 CONT John Rutledge, elder brother of Edward Rutledge, signer of the 
1 CONC Declaration of Independence, was born into a large family at or near 
1 CONC Charleston, SC, in 1739. He received his early education from his father, 
1 CONC an Irish immigrant and physician, and from an Anglican minister and a 
1 CONC tutor. After studying law at London's Middle Temple in 1760, he was 
1 CONC admitted to English practice. But, almost at once, he sailed back to 
1 CONC Charleston to begin a fruitful legal career and to amass a fortune in 
1 CONC plantations and slaves. Three years later, he married Elizabeth Grimke, 
1 CONC who eventually bore him 10 children, and moved into a townhouse, where he 
1 CONC resided most of the remainder of his life.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1761 Rutledge became politically active. That year, on behalf of 
1 CONC Christ Church Parish, he was elected to the provincial assembly and held 
1 CONC his seat until the War for Independence. For 10 months in 1764 he 
1 CONC temporarily held the post of provincial attorney-general. When the 
1 CONC troubles with Great Britain intensified about the time of the Stamp Act 
1 CONC in 1765, Rutledge, who hoped to ensure continued self-government for the 
1 CONC colonies, sought to avoid severance from the British and maintained a 
1 CONC restrained stance. He did, however, chair a committee of the Stamp Act 
1 CONC Congress that drew up a petition to the House of Lords.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1774 Rutledge was sent to the First Continental Congress, where he 
1 CONC pursued a moderate course. After spending the next year in the Second 
1 CONC Continental Congress, he returned to South Carolina and helped reorganize 
1 CONC its government. In 1776 he served on the committee of safety and took 
1 CONC part in the writing of the state constitution. That year, he also became 
1 CONC president of the lower house of the legislature, a post he held until 
1 CONC 1778. During this period, the new government met many stern tests.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1778 the conservative Rutledge, disapproving of democratic revisions 
1 CONC in the state constitution, resigned his position. The next year, however, 
1 CONC he was elected as governor. It was a difficult time. The British were 
1 CONC invading South Carolina, and the military situation was desperate. Early 
1 CONC in 1780, by which time the legislature had adjourned, Charleston was 
1 CONC besieged. In May it fell, the American army was captured, and the British 
1 CONC confiscated Rutledge's property. He ultimately escaped to North Carolina 
1 CONC and set about attempting to rally forces to recover South Carolina. In 
1 CONC 1781, aided by Gen. Nathanael Greene and a new Continental Army force, he 
1 CONC reestablished the government. In January 1782 he resigned the 
1 CONC governorship and took a seat in the lower house of the legislature. He 
1 CONC never recouped the financial losses he suffered during the war.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1782-83 Rutledge was a delegate to the Continental Congress. He next 
1 CONC sat on the state chancery court (1784) and again in the lower house of 
1 CONC the legislature (1784-90). One of the most influential delegates at the 
1 CONC Constitutional Convention, where he maintained a moderate nationalist 
1 CONC stance and chaired the Committee of Detail, he attended all the sessions, 
1 CONC spoke often and effectively, and served on five committees. Like his 
1 CONC fellow South Carolina delegates, he vigorously advocated southern 
1 CONC interests.
1 CONT
1 CONT The new government under the Constitution soon lured Rutledge. He was a 
1 CONC Presidential elector in 1789 and Washington then appointed him as 
1 CONC Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, but for some reason he 
1 CONC apparently served only a short time. In 1791 he became chief justice of 
1 CONC the South Carolina supreme court. Four years later, Washington again 
1 CONC appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court, this time as Chief Justice to 
1 CONC replace John Jay. But Rutledge's outspoken opposition to Jay'sTreaty 
1 CONC (1794), and the intermittent mental illness he had suffered from since 
1 CONC the death of his wife in 1792, caused the Federalist-dominated Senate to 
1 CONC reject his appointment and end his public career. Meantime, however, he 
1 CONC had presided over one term of the Court.
1 CONT
1 CONT Rutledge died in 1800 at the age of 60 and was interred at St. Michael's 
1 CONC Episcopal Church in Charleston.

1 CONT
1 CONT RUTLEDGE, John, statesman, born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1739; 
1 CONC died there, 23 July, 1800. He was the eldest son of Dr. John Rutledge, 
1 CONC who came to South Carolina from the north of Ireland about 1735, 
1 CONC practiced medicine in Charleston, and married a lady of fortune, leaving 
1 CONC her a widow with seven children at the age of twenty-seven. The son, who 
1 CONC was sent to England to study law at the Temple, returned to Charleston in 
1 CONC 1761, and acquired a high reputation as an advocate. He was an earnest 
1 CONC opponent of the stamp-act when it was discussed in the provincial 
1 CONC assembly, was sent to the congress at New York in October, 1765, and with 
1 CONC his colleague, Christopher Gadsden, boldly advocated colonial union and 
1 CONC resistance to oppression. He was a member of the South Carolina 
1 CONC convention of 1774, in which he argued in favor of making common cause 
1 CONC with Massachusetts, and carried a resolution that South Carolina should 
1 CONC take part in the proposed congress, and that her delegates should go 
1 CONC unhampered by instructions. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He was one of those that were chosen by the planters to represent them in 
1 CONC the first Continental congress at Philadelphia. Patrick Henry pronounced 
1 CONC him "by far the greatest orator" in that assembly. In 1775 he was again 
1 CONC chosen a delegate to congress. He was chairman of the committee that 
1 CONC framed a constitution for South Carolina in 1776, and on 27 March was 
1 CONC elected president of the new government, and commander-in-chief of the 
1 CONC military forces. When the British fleet arrived in Cape Fear river he 
1 CONC fortified Charleston, and insisted on retaining the post on Sullivan's 
1 CONC island when General Charles Lee proposed its evacuation. During the 
1 CONC battle he sent 500 pounds of powder, and directed Colonel William 
1 CONC Moultrie not to retreat without an order from him, adding that he would " 
1 CONC sooner cut off his right hand than write one." He was dissatisfied with 
1 CONC changes in the constitution, and in March, 1778, resigned his office, but 
1 CONC in the following year he was chosen governor again by an almost unanimous 
1 CONC vote of the legislature, superseding Rawlins Lowndes. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He was clothed with dictatorial powers, and prepared to repel the British 
1 CONC invasion. When General Augustine Prevost advanced upon Charleston in May, 
1 CONC 1779, the city was defenseless. General Benjamin Lincoln with the 
1 CONC Continental troops being 150 miles away. The latter hastened to the 
1 CONC succor of Charleston by forced marches, and state troops were gathered 
1 CONC for the same object. It was proposed by the governor's council that the 
1 CONC British should retire, on condition that South Carolina should remain 
1 CONC neutral during the rest of the war, and that her fate should be 
1 CONC determined by the issue of the conflict. This measure, which the 
1 CONC historian Ramsay thinks was a ruse, devised for the purpose of gaining 
1 CONC time, was favored by Rutledge, but opposed by Gadsden, the younger 
1 CONC Laurens, and Noultrie. On Lincoln's approach, the enemy retreated, and 
1 CONC Rutledge, at the head of the militia, took the field against the 
1 CONC invaders. 
1 CONT
1 CONT When Charleston was captured by Sir Henry Clinton in 1780, Governor 
1 CONC Rutledge retired into North Carolina, and until the close of hostilities 
1 CONC accompanied the army of General Nathanael Greene, and participated in its 
1 CONC operations. When South Carolina was partly redeemed from the conquerors, 
1 CONC he resumed the duties of governor, summoning the assembly at 
1 CONC Jacksonborough in January, 1782. He retired from the governorship in that 
1 CONC year, and was elected to the Continental congress. In that body he 
1 CONC opposed a general impost, except for the purpose of paying the army. He 
1 CONC was returned to congress in 1783, and in March, 1784, after declining the 
1 CONC mission to the Hague, he was appointed chancellor of South Carolina. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He was a member of the convention that framed the Federal constitution, 
1 CONC in which he was one of a committee of five that reported a ratio of 
1 CONC representation more favorable to the south than that which was finally 
1 CONC adopted, and was chairman of the committee of detail. He advocated the 
1 CONC assumption of all the state debts by the Federal government, threatened a 
1 CONC secession of the south if the slave-trade were prohibited, proposed that 
1 CONC congress should elect the president, and in the discussion of the powers 
1 CONC and constitution of the judiciary exercised an influential voice. When 
1 CONC the constitution went into operation he was nominated a justice of the 
1 CONC United States supreme court, but de-dined in order to accept the chief 
1 CONC justiceship of his native state. On 1 July, 1795, he was appointed chief 
1 CONC justice of the United States supreme court. He presided at the August 
1 CONC term. but when the senate met in December his mind had become diseased, 
1 CONC and the nomination was rejected.

1 CONT John Rutledge
1 CONT
1 CONT 1739-1800 Unquestionalbly the great character of South Carolina during 
1 CONC the Revolution was John Rutledge, who was for a time invested with 
1 CONC dictatorial powers. He possessed all the qualities which constitute the 
1 CONC man born to win and command--an eloquence of astonishing power, and a 
1 CONC daring and decision of will which always placed him before his 
1 CONC fellow-countrymen. He was born in South Carolina in 1739. At the 
1 CONC commencement of the Revolution he was by successive elections a member of 
1 CONC Congress till the year 1776, when he was elected president and 
1 CONC commander-in-chief of South Carolina, in conformity to a constitution 
1 CONC established by the people in that year. In this office he rendered 
1 CONC important service to his country. In 1787 he assisted in framing a 
1 CONC national constitution; and as soon as it was in operation, he was 
1 CONC designated by President Washington as first associate judge of the 
1 CONC supreme court of the United States.

1 CONC EDWARD RUTLEDGE was born in Charleston, South Carolina on November 23, 
1 CONC 1749. He was the youngest of the seven children of Dr. John Rutledge who 
1 CONC came to South Carolina from the north of Ireland about 1735. After 
1 CONC acquiring a classical education, young Ned as he was called, read law 
1 CONC with his older brother John, ten years his senior who guided him in his 
1 CONC career as a lawyer. He was entered as a student at the Temple, a 
1 CONC prestigious school in London, England in 1769. He attended the courts of 
1 CONC law and the houses of parliament for four years, and on being called to 
1 CONC the bar, returned to Charleston and entered into practice.
1 CONT
1 CONT Rutledge married the wealthy daughter of Henry Middleton, Henrietta, and 
1 CONC subsequently built a home across the street from the house of his 
1 CONC brothers John and Hugh. Ned was nearly bald despite his age and 
1 CONC "inclining toward corpulency", entered into public life in 1774, when he 
1 CONC was elected to the First Continental Congress, with the help of his 
1 CONC brother John and his father-in-law, who were both respected politicians. 
1 CONC Members of the plantation aristocracy entered prominently into public 
1 CONC life at an amazingly early age, and young Rutledge was a member of 
1 CONC congress before he was twenty-five. However, he did not make too 
1 CONC favorable an impression at this first meeting. He excited the scorn of 
1 CONC John Adams, never an admirer of the South Carolinians, who wrote in his 
1 CONC diary "Young Ned Rutledge is a perfect Bob-o-Lincoln, a swallow, a 
1 CONC sparrow, a peacock; excessively vain, excessively weak, and excessively 
1 CONC variable and unsteady; jejeune, inane, and puerile."
1 CONT
1 CONT By June 1776 at the Second Congress, Rutledge, although opposed to 
1 CONC independence, gained strength and recognition as one of the more 
1 CONC influential members of congress and was selected to sit on the important 
1 CONC War and Ordinance Committee. His motions against independence were 
1 CONC endless. While he did his best to delay the vote for independence, he is 
1 CONC generally held responsible for the postponement of the vote on the 
1 CONC resolution of independence, he is also given the major credit for the 
1 CONC decision of the South Carolina delegation to go along with the others on 
1 CONC July 2 for the sake on unanimity. Edward Rutledge holds the distinction 
1 CONC of being the youngest signer of the Declaration.
1 CONT
1 CONT Rutledge left Congress six months later, in the autumn of 1776 and 
1 CONC returned to the low country. He distinguished himself as an officer in 
1 CONC the militia and as a representative in the state legislature. Although he 
1 CONC was re-elected to Congress, he did not get back to Philadelphia. Along 
1 CONC with his brother-in-law Arthur Middleton, Rutledge was captured when 
1 CONC Charleston fell and was imprisoned in St. Augustine.
1 CONT
1 CONT After the war Rutledge was active in the legislature and in state 
1 CONC conventions. In his home country he had always been thought a genial and 
1 CONC charming gentleman, and no doubt he mellowed with the years. In 1798 he 
1 CONC became governor of his state, but he died on January 23, 1800 before 
1 CONC completing his term. He was only a few months past fifty. His first wife, 
1 CONC Henrietta, bore him three children, but his second marriage, to Mrs. Mary 
1 CONC Shubrick Eveleigh, was childless.

1 CONT EDWARD RDTLEDGE (1749-1800), a signer of the Declaration of Independence, 
1 CONC was born in Charleston on the 23rd November 1749. He studied law in his 
1 CONC brother's office, and in London in 1769-73, and began to practise in 
1 CONC Charleston in 1773. He served in the Continental Congress in 1774-77, and 
1 CONC was sent with John Adams and Benjamin Franklin to confer on' terms' 
1 CONC of-peace with Lord Howe on Staten Island in September 1776. As captain of 
1 CONC artillery and later as lieutenant-colonel he 'served against the British 
1 CONC in South Carolina in 1779-80. He was captured near Charleston in 1780 and 
1 CONC was imprisoned at St Augustine, Florida for a year. He was a member of 
1 CONC -the state legislature from 1782 to 1798, and in 1791 drafted the act 
1 CONC which abolished primogeniture in South Carolina. From 1798 until his 
1 CONC death in Charleston, on the 23rd of January 1800, he was governor of 
1 CONC South Carolina.

1 CONT Edward Rutledge
1 CONT 1749-1800
1 CONT Delegate to the Continental Congress from South Carolina, 1774-76, 1779
1 CONT Born:  November 23, 1749 
1 CONT Birthplace:  Charleston, S.C. 
1 CONT Education:  Graduate of Oxford, Studied at Middle Temple (London), Member 
1 CONC of the English Bar (Lawyer) 
1 CONT Work:  State Legislator, Representative to the Continental Congress, 
1 CONC 1774-76, 1779; Captain, Charleston Battalion of Artillery, 1776-1779; 
1 CONC State legislator, 1782-1796; College of Electors, 1788, 1792, 1796; 
1 CONC Elected Governor for South Carolina, 1798. 
1 CONT Died:  January 23, 1800 
1 CONT
1 CONT Born to an aristocratic Family in South Carolina, Edward Rutledge was 
1 CONC perhaps destined to a life of Public service. He was educated in law at 
1 CONC Oxford and studied for and was admitted to the English Bar. He and his 
1 CONC brother John were both engaged in the law, and both attended the 
1 CONC congress. They supported each other unabashedly, both on the floor and in 
1 CONC committee. Edward attended Congress at the remarkable age of 
1 CONC twenty-seven, and was no doubt pretty excited to find himself in the 
1 CONC company of the most eminent men of the colonies.
1 CONT
1 CONT He took leave of Congress in November of 1776 to join the defense of his 
1 CONC colony. He was a member of the Charleston Battalion of Artillery, engaged 
1 CONC in several important battles, and attained the rank of Captain. The 
1 CONC colonial legislature sent him back to Congress in 1779 to fill a vacancy. 
1 CONC He took his leave again in 1780 when the British conducted a third 
1 CONC invasion of South Carolina. He resumed his post as Captain in the defense 
1 CONC of Charleston, was captured and held prisoner until July of 1781.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1782 he returned to the legislature of his native state, where he 
1 CONC served until 1796. He was a very active member, intent on the prosecution 
1 CONC of British Loyalists. At times he served on as many nineteen committees. 
1 CONC He also served as an elector, in 1788, 1792, and in 1796 when, despite 
1 CONC his avowed allegiance to the Federalist party, he voted for Thomas 
1 CONC Jefferson. He was then elected to the state Senate, twice, and in 1789 
1 CONC was elected Governor. This would be his last office. His health 
1 CONC declining, he was barely able to complete his term as Governor. He died 
1 CONC in January of 1800 at the age of fifty-one.

1 CONT Edward Rutledge
1 CONT 1749-1800
1 CONT Edward Rutledge, the first of the South Carolina delegation, who affixes 
1 CONC his name to the Declaration of Independence, was born in the city of 
1 CONC Charleston, November, 1749. He was the youngest, son of Doctor John 
1 CONC Rutledge, who emigrated from Ireland to South Carolina, about the year 
1 CONC 1735. His mother was Sarah Hert, a lady of respectable family, and large 
1 CONC fortune. At the age of twenty-seven, she became a widow with seven 
1 CONC children. Her eldest son was John Rutledge, distinguished for his 
1 CONC patriotic zeal during the revolution. Her youngest son was the subject of 
1 CONC the present memoir. 
1 CONT    Of the early years of Edward Rutledge we have little to record. He was 
1 CONC placed under the care of David Smith, of New Jersey, by whom he was 
1 CONC instructed in the learned languages; but he appears not to have made as 
1 CONC rapid attainments as some others, although, as a scholar, he was 
1 CONC respectable. Before he had devoted as much time to academic studies, as 
1 CONC would have been desirable, he commenced the study of law with his elder 
1 CONC brother, who, at that time, was becoming the most eminent advocate at the 
1 CONC Charleston bar. Although at this time he was still young, he was capable 
1 CONC of appreciating the advantages which he enjoyed, and was strongly 
1 CONC impelled to exertion, by the brilliant and successful example which his 
1 CONC brother held constantly before him. 
1 CONT    In 1769, at the age of twenty years, he sailed for England, to 
1 CONC complete his legal education. He became a student at the Temple. He 
1 CONC derived great advantage from an attendance upon the English courts, and 
1 CONC houses of parliament. In the latter place, be had an opportunity of 
1 CONC listening to the eloquence of some of the most distinguished orators who 
1 CONC lived at that day. 
1 CONT    In 1773, he returned to his native country, and entered upon the 
1 CONC duties of his profession. He was at this time distinguished for his 
1 CONC quickness of apprehension, fluency of speech, and graceful delivery. 
1 CONC Hence he early excited the admiration of those who heard him, and gave 
1 CONC promise of that future eminence to which he was destined to arrive. 
1 CONT    The general esteem in which be was held, was evinced in 1774, by his 
1 CONC appointment to the distinguished congress which assembled at Philadelphia 
1 CONC in that year. He was at this time but twenty-five years of age. It was a 
1 CONC high honor for so young a man to be called to serve in the national 
1 CONC council, with men of exalted powers and pre-eminent experience. It 
1 CONC furnished unquestionable proof of the estimation in which he was held, 
1 CONC and strong presumptive evidence that this estimation of his talents and 
1 CONC moral worth was not unjust. As the proceedings of the congress of 1774 
1 CONC were conducted with closed doors, and an injunction of secrecy laid upon 
1 CONC its members, it is impossible, at this day, to ascertain the precise 
1 CONC share of influence which the individual members exerted, on all the 
1 CONC measures which they advocated. Mr. Rutledge was, however, with the other 
1 CONC delegates of South Carolina, formally thanked by the provincial congress, 
1 CONC for the spirited and independent course he had pursued, and was again 
1 CONC elected to the important station which he held. 
1 CONT    In the congress of 1776, he took an active part in the discussions 
1 CONC which preceded the declaration of independence. He is said to have 
1 CONC proposed some alterations in the original draught of that celebrated 
1 CONC instrument: but the precise nature of them it is now impossible to 
1 CONC ascertain. The merit of the instrument doubtless wholly belongs to Mr. 
1 CONC Jefferson. Some alterations, indeed, were made in it but they were 
1 CONC chiefly verbal, while the spirit and texture remained untouched. 
1 CONT    At a subsequent date, Mr. Rutledge was appointed, with Dr. Franklin 
1 CONC and John Adams, as commissioners to wait upon Lord Howe, who had 
1 CONC requested congress to appoint such a committee to enter with him into 
1 CONC negotiations for peace. In a former page we had occasion to allude to the 
1 CONC appointment of these commissioners, and to state that the conference was 
1 CONC productive of no beneficial results. 
1 CONT    On the breaking up of the conference, Lord Howe dispatched his own 
1 CONC barge to convey the commissioners from Long Island to New York. A little 
1 CONC before reaching the shore, Doctor Franklin, putting his hand in his 
1 CONC pocket, began chinking some gold and silver coin. This, when about 
1 CONC leaving the boat, he offered to the sailors, who had rowed it. The 
1 CONC British officer, however, who commanded the boat, prohibited the sailors 
1 CONC accepting it. After the departure of the boat, one of the commissioners 
1 CONC inquired why he had offered money to the sailors. "Why," said the doctor, 
1 CONC in reply, "the British think we have no hard money in the colonies, and I 
1 CONC thought I would show them to the contrary. I risked nothing," added he, 
1 CONC "for I knew that the sailors would not be permitted to accept it." 
1 CONT    Mr. Rutledge was again appointed to congress in the year 1779; but in 
1 CONC consequence of ill health he was unable to reach the seat of government, 
1 CONC and returned home. In 1780, during the investment of Charleston by the 
1 CONC British, Mr. Rutledge was taken prisoner by the enemy, and sent to St. 
1 CONC Augustine as a prisoner, where be was detained nearly a year before he 
1 CONC was exchanged. Soon after his exchange was effected, he landed at 
1 CONC Philadelphia, near which he resided, until a short time before the city 
1 CONC of Charleston was evacuated by the British, when he returned to the place 
1 CONC of his nativity, and to the enjoyment of the society of his friends and 
1 CONC relations. 
1 CONT    From this period, for the space of seventeen years, Mr. Rutledge was 
1 CONC successfully engaged in the practice of his profession, and from time to 
1 CONC time in important services which he rendered to the state, as a member of 
1 CONC her legislature. 
1 CONT    In 1798, he relinquished his station at the bar, and was elected the 
1 CONC chief magistrate of South Carolina. His constitution, however, became 
1 CONC much impaired in consequence of severe and repeated attacks of the gout, 
1 CONC to which he was subject. He continued, however, to perform his official 
1 CONC duties until within a short time before his death. This event is supposed 
1 CONC to have been somewhat hastened, by a necessary attendance upon the 
1 CONC sitting of the legislature at Columbia, and an unfortunate exposure to 
1 CONC rain and cold during his return from the latter place to Charleston. On 
1 CONC reaching home, he was confined by a severe illness, which terminated his 
1 CONC life on the 23rd day of January, 1800. 
1 CONT    The death of Mr. Rutledge was felt to be a severe loss, both by the 
1 CONC people of Charleston and by the state at large. Few men were more 
1 CONC deservedly respected; no one could be more generally beloved. Military 
1 CONC and other funeral honors were paid to him on the occasion of his being 
1 CONC carried to his long home; and the universal regret expressed at his 
1 CONC departure, showed full well how sincerely he was lamented. 
1 CONT    Both in his public and private character, Mr. Rutledge was adorned 
1 CONC with many virtues. In his disposition, be was uncommonly benevolent; he 
1 CONC entered with great feeling into the sufferings of his fellow men, and 
1 CONC felt it not only his duty, but his pleasure, to administer to their 
1 CONC necessities. His deeds of kindness were many, were widely extended, and 
1 CONC are still remembered with affection and gratitude. 
1 CONT    As an orator, he was deservedly eminent. He had faults indeed, both in 
1 CONC point of manner and style, being too studied in respect to the former, 
1 CONC and too metaphorical, and sometimes inaccurate, in respect to the latter. 
1 CONC He also, it is said, addressed himself rather to the passions than to the 
1 CONC understanding; yet, with these faults there were few speakers who 
1 CONC commanded greater attention, or were more successful. He was less 
1 CONC impetuous, and perhaps less commanding, than his brother John Rutledge; 
1 CONC but he possessed more of the style of Cicero. There was a suavity in his 
1 CONC manner, a conciliatory attraction in his arguments, which had frequently 
1 CONC the effect of subduing the prejudices of the unfriendly, and which seldom 
1 CONC failed to increase the ardor and inflexibility of steady friends. The 
1 CONC eloquence of John Rutledge, like that of Patrick Henry of Virginia, was 
1 CONC as a mountain torrent; that of Edward Rutledge, that of a smooth stream 
1 CONC gliding along the plain; the former hurried you forward with a resistless 
1 CONC impetuosity; the latter conducted you with fascinations, that made every 
1 CONC progressive step appear enchanting. 
1 CONT    In his person, Mr. Rutledge was above the middle size, and of a 
1 CONC florid, but fair complexion. His countenance expressed great animation; 
1 CONC and, on account of his intelligent and benevolent aspect, was universally 
1 CONC admired. 
1 CONT    On his return from Europe, Mr. Rutledge married the daughter of Henry 
1 CONC Middleton, by whom he left a son, Major Henry M. Rutledge, of Tennessee; 
1 CONC and a daughter, who, it is believed, now resides at Charleston. Upon the 
1 CONC death of his first wife, he married the widow of Nicholas Eveleigh, 
1 CONC comptroller of the treasury of the United States, in the time of 
1 CONC Washington's administration. This lady is supposed to be still living [in 
1 CONC 1829].

1 CONT 1740-1825 Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, distinguished as a patriot, 
1 CONC soldier and diplomatist, was born in South Carolina in 1740. . He was a 
1 CONC member of the convention which framed the constitution of the United 
1 CONC States, and afterward, in the convention of South Carolina, assembled for 
1 CONC deliberating upon the instrument, he contributed greatly to its adoption.

1 CONT
1 CONT 1758-1824 Charles Pinckney was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in the 
1 CONC year 1758. Unaided by a college education, he became by the assistance of 
1 CONC private instructors a proficient in the languages of Greece, Rome, and 
1 CONC France, and in all acquirements necessary to form a statesman. Ardent and 
1 CONC impassioned in the pursuit of literature and distinction, he did not long 
1 CONC remain unknown. At the commencement of the Revolution, he took a share in 
1 CONC the struggle for independence, and was one of those patriots who 
1 CONC underwent seven years calamity to restore liberty and independence to his 
1 CONC country. At the age of twenty-seven, Mr. Pinckney was elected a member of 
1 CONC the State legislature, which place he held until the year 1787, when he 
1 CONC was unanimously elected by that body one of the delegates to the federal 
1 CONC convention which met at Philadelphia to frame the present constitution. 
1 CONC Though youngest in this august body, yet he has been ranked among the 
1 CONC most conspicuous in eloquence and efficiency. He advocated an energetic 
1 CONC general government. Of the various propositions which he originated, 
1 CONC there is one which, though not a part of the constitution, yet the people 
1 CONC appear to have adopted in practice. This was, that the president's tenure 
1 CONC should be seven years, and afterward ineligible. :By custom he is 
1 CONC continued for eight years, but the example of Washington in declining a 
1 CONC third election, has established the utmost limit of a president's term.

1 CONC The Reverend John Wardman began getting rid of the sanctuary clutter in 
1 CONC the 1970s and Revd David David Murray, who arrived in 1983, 
1 CONC revolutionised the whole concept. A number of alterations were made to 
1 CONC the interior of the church including the removing of canopies above the 
1 CONC pulpit and lectern, and wrought iron work near the chancel steps and 
1 CONC around the baptistry.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Reverend Ron Dowling was installed as Rector in 1989. and during his 
1 CONC incumbencey a number of changes were made both in the worship liturgy and 
1 CONC in the physical appearance of the church. The communion rails were 
1 CONC removed and the altar brought forward to the centre of the sanctuary. In 
1 CONC 1997 the entire church was re-wired and later re-painted.
1 CONT
1 CONT Also, during Ron Dowling's 'reign' a suggestion was put forward in 1991 
1 CONC that part of the church site be set aside for a retirement village which 
1 CONC would be built under the auspices of Anglican Homes. Although the 
1 CONC original plan was to demolish all the buildings on the site except the 
1 CONC church it was later modified so that the hall was included in the 
1 CONC development and the original art deco style retained. In return the 
1 CONC church would obtain a new hall and office premises as well as two clergy 
1 CONC houses.
1 CONT
1 CONT The new plans for a village comprising thirteen retirement dwellings plus 
1 CONC two clergy houses were accepted and the complex named 'St Mary�s Close'. 
1 CONC Together with new church developments the buildings were completed and 
1 CONC later blessed by Archbishop Peter Carnley on 28 November 1993.
1 CONT
1 CONT Although the social history of the Parish lies beyond the scope of this 
1 CONC website, Gary James Martin�s book, �By Water and the Word�, provides a 
1 CONC comprehensive story of the trials and tribulations, the good times and 
1 CONC the bad times, which make up the living history of St Mary�s Parish, its 
1 CONC clergy and congregations.   Published in 1998 the book is available from 
1 CONC our Parish Office (click here for the address).
1 CONT
1 CONT These web pages have briefly described the history of St Mary�s from an 
1 CONC architectural and building perspective. Many of the facts are set out in 
1 CONC the book by Gary James Martin. Gary's research into the history of St 
1 CONC Mary's is duly acknowledged here.

1 CONC Margaret Olley was born in Lismore, New South Wales in 1923 and is 
1 CONC recognised as one of Australia's foremost still life painters. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Margaret Olley's paintings depict intimate interiors and colourful 
1 CONC environments. Her still life's and interiors reflect the objects within 
1 CONC her surroundings and the characteristics of the immediate world around 
1 CONC her. 
1 CONT
1 CONT The objects that Margaret Olley brings into her home are not for their 
1 CONC pleasant decorative aesthetics but more so for their paint-ability. It is 
1 CONC seldom that Olley paints a single object but prefers a magnitude of items 
1 CONC in her compositions that produces a 'dialogue between the purity of 
1 CONC shapes and their spatial relationships'. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Margaret Olley is not easily influenced by the changing movements and 
1 CONC fashions of the fine art world. 'Although she is well aware and tolerant 
1 CONC of current trends, Margaret Olley makes no stylistic concessions to 
1 CONC fashion in her painting? Olley's independence from stylistic trends 
1 CONC placed her in a similar position to Lloyd Rees during the 1960s. They 
1 CONC were not seen to be mainstream or avant garde, but ? critics usually gave 
1 CONC them positive reviews.' Margaret Olley, Christine France, Craftsman 
1 CONC House, Sydney, 2002, pp46-72. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Margaret Olley has held more than sixty solo exhibitions during her 
1 CONC career, her first show in Sydney in 1948. She has been the recipient of 
1 CONC numerous awards and prizes including the Mosman Art Prize in 1947 and the 
1 CONC Helena Rubinstein Portrait Prize in 1962. In 1997 a major retrospective 
1 CONC of Margaret Olley's work was organised by the Art Gallery of New South 
1 CONC Wales, the same year she was declared an "Australian National Treasure". 
1 CONC In 2000 Olley was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letter from the 
1 CONC University of Queensland and an Honorary Doctorate of Visual Arts from 
1 CONC the University of Sydney. 
1 CONT
1 CONT On June 12, 2006 Margaret Olley was awarded Australia's highest civilian 
1 CONC honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia, for her commitment to 
1 CONC art and philanthropy. Savill Galleries has a long association with the 
1 CONC work of Margaret Olley. The gallery will consider the purchase of any 
1 CONC authentic Margaret Olley paintings held in private or public collection. 
1 CONC The exhibition 'Margaret Olley: Life's Journey' is currently showing at 
1 CONC the Newcastle Region Art Gallery, 15 August ? 26 October 2000. 
1 CONT
1 CONT "Margaret Olley: Life's journey provides a unique insight into the world 
1 CONC of National Trust Living Treasure, Margaret Olley, one of this country?s 
1 CONC most celebrated artists. The exhibition traces the many places Olley has 
1 CONC lived and worked from the late 1940s to the 1970s, years which helped 
1 CONC define an important era in Australia's cultural life. 
1 CONT
1 CONT This is the first survey exhibition of Margaret Olley?s work that 
1 CONC examines sketches and watercolours significant to the artist?s journeys 
1 CONC of discovery. Concentrating on pen and ink and watercolour studies, more 
1 CONC than 80 works on paper have been selected from national, state and 
1 CONC private collections, as well as the artist's own, providing a rare and 
1 CONC unique look at Olley's extraordinary artistic career.

1 CONT Monday, 21/08/2006
1 CONT
1 CONT NSW cattle breeder and pastoralist David Wright has died. He established 
1 CONC a new breed of cattle and created an empire in the beef industry, only to 
1 CONC see it crumble in the 1980s. Brooke Daniels spoke to close friend and 
1 CONC founder of the beef CRC, Bernie Bindon. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Phillip David Arundell Wright, one of the pioneers of modern beef 
1 CONC production, died suddenly in Armidale on Sunday following a massive heart 
1 CONC attack. Mr Wright headed the Wallamumbi Station east of Armidale where he 
1 CONC took the oldest hereford herd in Australia and cross-bred it with new 
1 CONC genetics. He developed his own V2V beefmaker breed and in so doing both 
1 CONC shocked the traditionalists and firmly placed the state's New England 
1 CONC region on national and international maps. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Long-time friend and founder of the Armidale based co-operative research 
1 CONC centre for beef Bernie Bindon says no single man could claim as much 
1 CONC responsibility for the strength of the Australian beef industry as David 
1 CONC Wright.
1 CONT
1 CONT In this report: Bernie Bindon, founder of the CRC for beef.

1 CONC The following is a quote from "The Year of Three Kings 1483" by Giles St 
1 CONC Aubyn. 
1 CONT Atheneum, New York, 1983.
1 CONT
1 CONT  
1 CONT No King since the Norman Conquest had married a commoner, so the news 
1 CONC that Edward IV had taken Elizabeth Woodville for his wife created 
1 CONC consternation. Indeed, the m�salliance proved disastrous to his dynasty. 
1 CONC In the next century, the matrimonial misadventures of his grandson Henry 
1 CONC VIII showed once more how rash it could be for a sovereign to marry a 
1 CONC subject.
1 CONT
1 CONT Nevertheless, it was a gross distortion of truth to describe the new 
1 CONC Queen as of 'mean calling' and 'humble origin'. In fact, her mother, 
1 CONC Jacquetta, claimed descent from Charlemagne through her father the Count 
1 CONC of St Pol and was the widow of Henry V's brother, the Duke of Bedford. 
1 CONC Richard Woodville, her second husband, was less exulted but was 
1 CONC nevertheless a Knight of the Garter, a Privy Councellor and a peer. 
1 CONC Inevitably Elizabeth was criticized for her Lancastrian connections. Her 
1 CONC father and her brother Anthony fought against Edward IV at Towton; and 
1 CONC her first husband, Sir John Grey, heir to Lord Ferrers of Groby, died 
1 CONC fighting for Henry VI while commanding the last furious cavalry assault 
1 CONC at the Second Battle of St Albans.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Woodvilles had lived at Grafton in Northamptonshire since the 11th 
1 CONC century and it seems probable that Elizabeth returned there after Sir 
1 CONC John was killed. Edward is known to have stayed at Stony Stratford, a few 
1 CONC miles south of Grafton, on two occasions in 1461: on his way from 
1 CONC Mortimer's Cross to London and on his return from the Batttle of Towton. 
1 CONC Tradition has it that the young widow waylaid him out hunting and 
1 CONC implored him not to deprive her two boys of their father's estates. The 
1 CONC oak tree under which she supposedly stood when she first met the King 
1 CONC survives to the present day. Her austere beauty, demure smile and 
1 CONC beguiling wit instantly won his heart. Nor did he long to possess her 
1 CONC less when she refused to become his mistress. Indeed, 'where he was a 
1 CONC little before heated with the dart of Cupid, he was now set all on a hot 
1 CONC burning fire'. It was even rumoured that he tried to seduce her by force 
1 CONC but that she resolved 'to die rather than live unchastely'. A couple of 
1 CONC years after they were married an Italian writer, Antonio Cornazzano wrote 
1 CONC a poem in which Edward reproaches Elizabeth for 'witholding her tribute 
1 CONC of love'. She replies by seizing a daggar and warning him:
1 CONT
1 CONT           If my honour is taken from me,
1 CONT           I will pierce my body to the ground with this knife.
1 CONT
1 CONT So besotted was the King that he fell back on a most desperate resort; 
1 CONC marriage. In so doing, he defied the protests of his family, the warnings 
1 CONC of his Councellors and the dictates of expediency.
1 CONT
1 CONT Most people could see little to recommend the Queen, apart from her 
1 CONC graceful appearance and she was commonly regarded as an avaricious 
1 CONC upstart. Certainly her devotion to the interests of her family was such 
1 CONC as to encourage that construction. But she did not merit all the obloquy 
1 CONC which envy heaped upon her. By patronising the arts she played a valuable 
1 CONC role in civilising the Court. One of the first books, if not the 
1 CONC earliest, which Caxton printed in England was translated from the French 
1 CONC by her brother, Anthony. A picture in the Library at Lambeth Palace shows 
1 CONC him presenting a copy of 'The Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers' to 
1 CONC Edward IV in the presence of two future Kings: Edward V and Richard III.
1 CONT
1 CONT Edward's mother is alleged to have made strenuous efforts to persuade him 
1 CONC to change his mind, protesting that it would be to his 'honour, profit 
1 CONC and surety also, to marry in a noble pogency out of his realm', and 
1 CONC arguing that 'it is not princely to marry his subject for a little wanton 
1 CONC dotage on her person'. She even objected to the fact that Dame Elizabeth 
1 CONC Grey was a widow. But the King, it is said, insisted on his right to be 
1 CONC guided by his heart and claimed that as God has inclined 'the parties to 
1 CONC love together' it was preferable to bow to His will than to seek 'any 
1 CONC temporal advantage'. Nor could he believe that his fellow-countrymen 
1 CONC would hold it against him 'that he distained not to marry with one of his 
1 CONC own land'. Finally, the fact that the lady was a widow with two lusty 
1 CONC sons suggested that the union would prove fruitful: an argument whose 
1 CONC cogency was later confirmed by ten royal children.
1 CONT
1 CONT Edward was secretly married at Grafton on 1 May 1464. He spent the 
1 CONC previous night at Stony Stratford but rose so early next morning that 
1 CONC nobody saw him leave. The ceremony was probably conducted by Thomas 
1 CONC Leson, the incumbent of St Mary the Virgin, the church adjoining the 
1 CONC Manor. An Act of 1484, designed to justify the deposition of Edward V, 
1 CONC alleged that the service took place 'privily and secretly without edition 
1 CONC of banns, in a private chamber, a profane place, and not openly in the 
1 CONC face of the Church'. The wedding was solemnized in the presence of 'the 
1 CONC spouse, the spousesse, the Duchess of Bedford, the priest and two 
1 CONC gentlemen and a young man who helped the priest to sing'. No other King 
1 CONC of England was ever married with so little ceremony. On his return to 
1 CONC Stony Stratford, Edward told his anxious courtiers that he had been out 
1 CONC hunting. Some days later he paid his parents-in-law an official visit at 
1 CONC Grafton, and Elizabeth was smuggled into his apartments after the 
1 CONC household retired for the night. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Edward was eventually compelled to confess his secret, at a Council held 
1 CONC at Reading in September 1464, in order to prevent Warwick committing him 
1 CONC to a matrimonial alliance with France. When the King was asked whether he 
1 CONC would agree to marry Loius XI's sister-in-law, Princess Bona of Savoy, he 
1 CONC replied 'in right merry guise that he would take to wife Dame Elizabeth 
1 CONC Grey', only to be told 'that she was not his match, however good and fair 
1 CONC she might be'. Many of the chief men of the kingdom were 'treuly chafyd' 
1 CONC to learn of Edward's 'dishonourable' marriage to which he had been 'led 
1 CONC by blind affection and not by rule of reason'. Warwick especially 
1 CONC resented being made to look foolish, and deplored the waning of his 
1 CONC influence over his cousin.
1 CONT
1 CONT Elizabeth Woodville had five brothers and six sisters. Her eldest brother 
1 CONC Anthony, who succeded his father as Earl Rivers in 1469, was the most 
1 CONC attractive member oif an unloved family. In some respects he was 
1 CONC grasping, ambitious and worldly, but he was also an accomplished 
1 CONC courtier, a chivalrous knight and a pious scholar. In 1460 he married an 
1 CONC heiress, Elizabeth Scales, who brought him considerable estates including 
1 CONC Sandringham. After Henry VI's defeat at Towton he abandoned the 
1 CONC Lancastrian cause nad transferred his allegiance to Edward IV. His 
1 CONC brother, Sir Edward Woodville acquired an unsavoury reputation as a 
1 CONC dissolute companion of the King, but appears to have exercised no 
1 CONC influence other than encouraging debauchery. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Lionel Woodville was more deserving and better rewarded. In 1472, at the 
1 CONC age of nineteen he was made Archdeacon of Oxford, in 1479 Chancellor of 
1 CONC Oxford and in 1482 Bishop of Salisbury.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Queen was understandably eager to promote the careers of her sons as 
1 CONC well as her brothers and sisters. In 1475 her eldest boy, Thomas Grey, 
1 CONC was made Marquis of Dorset and the following year a Knight of the Garter. 
1 CONC "The Marquis", as he was familiarly known, was one of the principal 
1 CONC 'promoters and companions' of the King's vices, along with his uncle, Sir 
1 CONC Edward, and his brother, Richard Grey. Indeed, the Queen only contrived 
1 CONC to retain her influence over her husband by tolerating his promiscuity, 
1 CONC perceiving that he was less interested in the capture of his quarry than 
1 CONC the exhilaration of the chase.
1 CONT
1 CONT Elizabeth used her influence to arrange seven splendid marriages for her 
1 CONC family. Her sister, Catherine, married the second Duke of Buckingham: her 
1 CONC brother, John, the Dowager Duchess of Norfolk; and her son, Thomas Grey, 
1 CONC the Duke of Exeter's daughter, Anne Holland. Four of her sisters married 
1 CONC Earls or their heirs, Margaret married Thomas, Earl of Arundel; Anne 
1 CONC married William Viscount Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, a 
1 CONC great-grandson of Edward III; Eleanor married Anthony, Lord Grey of 
1 CONC Ruthin, the Earl of Kent's son; while Mary became the wife of William 
1 CONC Herbert, second Earl of Pembroke. Within a couple of years of her own 
1 CONC marriage the Queen's kin had become a powerful political alliance.

1 CONC The following note appears on the Youdale Web Site:-
1 CONT
1 CONT Kathleen went to Canada in 1941 as a war bride. She was an information 
1 CONC officer in Ottawa, worked as a copy editor for the Globe and Mail (a 
1 CONC major Canadian newspaper) and then as a staff editor and associate editor 
1 CONC at Chatelaine (a major Canadian magazine) where she worked for 11 years 
1 CONC until retiring in 1973.
1 CONT
1 CONT Her first book was 'A Star of Death' published in 1960 by Geoffrey Bles, 
1 CONC a mystery set in Australia. After that she wrote 'The Masseys' published 
1 CONC in 1965, 'The Prince and his Lady' about the Duke of Kent and Madame St 
1 CONC Laurent published in 1970, 'Assassination of the Prime Minister' (Death 
1 CONC of Spencer Perceval) published in 1972, 'The Royal Duke' about the Duke 
1 CONC of Sussex, published in 1976, 'The Wheel of Things' about Lucy Maud 
1 CONC Montgomery (the author of 'Anne of Green Gables') published in 1975 and 
1 CONC 'The Founders of Australia' published in 1989, a biographical dictionary 
1 CONC of the first fleet. She has an Honary Degree from Australia and the 
1 CONC Australian Government has presented her with the Australian Medal (AM).
1 CONT
1 CONT Kathleen Mollie Gillen
1 CONT The degree of Doctor of Letters (honoris causa) was conferred upon 
1 CONC Kathleen Mollie Gillen at the Arts ceremony held at 11.30am on 13 April 
1 CONC 1995.
1 CONT
1 CONT Citation
1 CONT Presented by the Acting Vice-Chancellor and Principal D J Anderson
1 CONT
1 CONT Chancellor 
1 CONT
1 CONT I have the honour to present Mrs Kathleen Mollie Gillen AM for admission 
1 CONC to the degree of Doctor of Letters (honoris causa). 
1 CONT
1 CONT Mrs Gillen graduated in Arts from this University in 1930 and then worked 
1 CONC in London for some years before going to Canada with her Canadian 
1 CONC husband. She worked as a federal government information officer in Ottawa 
1 CONC and was active in the University Women's Club. In 1961 she moved to 
1 CONC Toronto and spent eleven years as associate editor and staff writer with 
1 CONC the Canadian magazine, Chatelaine. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Earlier, she had developed an interest in writing and in 1960 published a 
1 CONC thriller, Star of Death and the first of a series of short stories for 
1 CONC the Saturday Evening Post. Then, in steady succession, came a biography 
1 CONC of the Canadian Massey family, a book exploring the relationship between 
1 CONC the Duke of Kent (Queen Victoria's father) and his French mistress, and 
1 CONC an account of the assassination of Spencer Perceval, the only British 
1 CONC Prime Minister to have met such a death. In 1975, she published a 
1 CONC biography of L.M. Montgomery, Canada's best known writer of children's 
1 CONC fiction and author of the celebrated Ann of Green Gables series. Mrs 
1 CONC Gillen justifiably gained a high reputation for the quality of her 
1 CONC writing, the range of her interests and the depth of her research. In 
1 CONC 1965 she won the President's Medal of the University of Western Ontario 
1 CONC for a three-part series of articles on the Massey family. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Her standing has been further enhanced by the important contributions she 
1 CONC has made in more recent years to Australian history. She began in 1982 
1 CONC with an outstanding article on the reasons for the settlement of New 
1 CONC South Wales. This appeared in the prestigious English Historical Review 
1 CONC and stands out as a major contribution to a continuing controversy. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1985, she published The Search for John Small, which set new standards 
1 CONC for the writing of family history. For the Australian bicentenary she 
1 CONC wrote The Founders of Australia, a most impressive book, which analysed 
1 CONC the background to the First Fleet and contained meticulously researched 
1 CONC pen-pictures. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Mrs Gillen clearly is one of our more illustrious graduates and possesses 
1 CONC in abundance those qualities of mind and character which are the hallmark 
1 CONC of the dedicated scholar.
1 CONT
1 CONT Chancellor, I have the honour to present Mrs Kathleen Mollie Gillen for 
1 CONC admission to the degree of Doctor of Letters (honoris causa).
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT

1 CONT
1 CONT At the age of 10, her parents died within a few months of each other: her 
1 CONC father who was a medical doctor died from the epidemic of influenza due 
1 CONC to tending many patients after WWI. Mollie grew up under the care of her 
1 CONC grandparents. She graduated with a bachelor of arts from Sydney 
1 CONC University in 1930. 
1 CONT

1 CONC working in London in the 30s, and they moved to Canada after WWII. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Her writing career started in the 50s. As a federal government 
1 CONC information officer in Ottawa, she edited government journals. She was 
1 CONC also active on the executive of the University Women's Club of Ottawa, 
1 CONC becomeing as first vice-president. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Mollie's first mystery novel, Star of Death, was published in England in 
1 CONC 1960. Also her many short stories were published in various publications 
1 CONC including The Sunday Evening Post. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1961, she moved to Toronto and eventually became associate editor and 
1 CONC staff writer for the Canadian magazine Chatelaine. Mollie published 
1 CONC numerous articles for this women's magazine, concerning on social 
1 CONC problems in the community. 
1 CONT

1 CONC important to Canada and Australia including: The Masseys: Founding Family 
1 CONC (1965), The Prince and His Lady (1970), The Assassination of the Prime 
1 CONC Minister (1972), The Wheel of Things: A Biography of L.M. Montgomery 
1 CONC (1975), The Search for John Small (1985) and The Founders of Australia: A 
1 CONC Biographical Dictionary of the First Fleet (1989). 
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1995, she received Hon. D. Litt. from her alma mater for her work on 
1 CONC the First Fleet and the history of early Australia, and she also received 
1 CONC the Order of Australia for her enormous contributions to her home 
1 CONC country. 
1 CONT
1 CONT On November 1, 2008, Mollie celebrated her 100th birthday (pictures).

1 CONC JAMES WOOLNOUGH was a native of England, born at Eriswell in 1847. While 
1 CONC yet a lad, he came with his parents to Tasmania, and, in 1865, removed to 
1 CONC New South Wales, where, in 1871, he was accepted as a candidate for our 
1 CONC ministry. His appointments were to the Wellington, Carcoar, 
1 CONC Grafton-Wallsend, Singleton, east Maitland, Waverley, Newtown, Bowral, 
1 CONC and Burwood circuits. As a Circuit Minister his work was marked by many 
1 CONC evidences of the best kind of success, which was made visible in a number 
1 CONC of Circuits by handsome new Churches. He was not given to talking of his 
1 CONC doings, and in consequence, many of his friends did not know how much was 
1 CONC done in leading people to the knowledge of the Redeemer. His fine 
1 CONC literary taste, his relish for the poetic and the humorous, imparted 
1 CONC sparkle and freshness to his preaching. In addition to superintending 
1 CONC important circuits, he was several times Chairman of District, and in 
1 CONC 1897 was President of the Conference. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1896 he was appointed General Secretary to the Church Sustentation and 
1 CONC Extension Society and agent for the Church in its business with the 
1 CONC Government. In 1904 he became Custodian of Deeds. In this sphere his 
1 CONC quiet skill in finance was shown in the fashion in which he successfully 
1 CONC grapped (sic.) with chronic and great difficulties in Circuit and Trust 
1 CONC finance, often making that which was apparently impossible quite simple. 
1 CONC In all such things he was the trusted advisor of the Church, and results 
1 CONC fully justified the Churchs confidence in his counsel. The Special Help 
1 CONC Fund, by which �13,279 of old Circuits debts were liquidated at the time 
1 CONC of the Methodist union, as well as a Special Fund to meet the financial 
1 CONC difficulties arising out of the consummation of Methodist Union, were 
1 CONC originated and successfully carried to their issue by him. His management 
1 CONC of the Loan Funds materially increased their effectiveness, while his 
1 CONC system of dealing with grants improved conditions for all parties 
1 CONC concerned.
1 CONT
1 CONT The standing of our Church today among the commercial men of the city is 
1 CONC an impressive tribute to the sagacity and worth of Mr. Woolnough. But his 
1 CONC keenest delight in all this work arose from the knowledge that in these 
1 CONC ways he rendered much service to his brethren in the ministry as well as 
1 CONC to the work of the Church in all departments. He remained in active 
1 CONC service till the close of his life, though unable to leave his home for 
1 CONC six months previous to his death. Those days of inactivity were a great 
1 CONC trial, yet in wonderful patience and courage he cheerfully endured until 
1 CONC his relief came. He exchanged mortality for life on the 30th December, 
1 CONC 1914, in the 68th year of his age, and the 44th year of his ministry, 
1 CONC deeply regretted by the whole Church, in whose love he ever held a large 
1 CONC place. 
1 CONT
1 CONT James Woolnough married Phoebe Esther Hawke, who was American born. They 
1 CONC married in Bathurst in 1875, and had three children.
1 CONT Their first child, Walter George Woolnough, was a famous scientist. He 
1 CONC married Margaret I Wilson, and they had two children. More can be found 
1 CONC about him on the Bright Sparcs web site.
1 CONT Their second child, Robert edmund, was a doctor. He married Bertha Grace 
1 CONC Youdale, and was the father of prolific writer, Mollie Gillen. 
1 CONT Their third child, Sydney James, married Christian P McAllan.

1 CONT The Rev. James Woolnough.
1 CONT Clarence & Richmond Examiner - 29 June 1909
1 CONT The Methodist Church of this city is being I visited just now by the Rev. 
1 CONC James j Woolnough, general secretary: of the Home Mission and Extension 
1 CONC Society of that Church in the State. Mr. Woolnough is regarded by his 
1 CONC Church as'an expert in. financial affairs, and has the esteem and 
1 CONC confidence of city business men because of his ability to handle the 
1 CONC large financial interests of the Methodist connexion. Some few years ago 
1 CONC he was honoured by being elected as the President of the Con- ference. 
1 CONC His visit to Grafton is in con j nection with the anniversary of the 
1 CONC local Methodist Church. Mr. Woolnough was stationed here 35 years ago, 
1 CONC first as. � young man, and then as a married man, assisting the Rev. 
1 CONC Arthur Rutledge, who is now "known as Sir Arthur Rutledge, one of the 
1 CONC Supreme Court Judges in Queensland. The chief reason of Mr. Woolnough's 
1 CONC visit is to take counsel with the officers of the Methodist Church about 
1 CONC their building project, enabling them to decide whether to build a new 
1 CONC church or a Sunday School hall, and advise them as to the best 
1 CONC arrangements for giving effect to their decision. No doubt many friends 
1 CONC of "Auld Lang Syne" will be glad to renew acquaintance with their old 
1 CONC friend.

1 CONC Amy on 23rd August 1888.  In November 1894, he was separated from Amy and 
1 CONC was living at Ninon, Cordelia Street, South Brisbane.  A letter on file 
1 CONC answers his questions to solicitors concerning Amy's inheritance.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1896 he was registered as a doctor in NSW and in 1897, Victoria.  
1 CONC However it appears that he did not leave Queensland until 1900.
1 CONT
1 CONT At the time of their marriage James' address was Coffee Palace, Sydney 
1 CONC and Angela's was 39 Princes Street, Sydney. James maintained his contact 
1 CONC with Amy's sister Charlotte as she was a witness to James' second 
1 CONC marriage to Angela.
1 CONT
1 CONT He lived in Broken Hill, NSW from 1908 to 1913.
1 CONT He lived in South Australia for 10 years but when? Perhaps 1900 to 1908 
1 CONC and 1913 to 1915.
1 CONT He lived in Victoria from 1915 until his death in 1944.
1 CONT
1 CONT Both "Who's Who in Australia" and James' obitiuary say that he had one 
1 CONC daughter. As his death certificate says that he had no child with Angela, 
1 CONC the daughter referred to must have been either Enid or Angela from his 
1 CONC first marriage to Amy. This would probably indicate that the second 
1 CONC daughter died.

1 CONT (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)
1 CONT
1 CONT SYDNEY, Wednesday
1 CONT
1 CONT A sad accident occurred on the tramway line in Elizabeth-street about 6 
1 CONC o'clock this evening, by which the Hon. George Oakes, M.L.C., lost his 
1 CONC life. It appears that the deceased gentleman waa waiting at the tram- way 
1 CONC station, intending to return home from the Council, and stepped out on to 
1 CONC the roadway in order to see if the tram car for Redfern was approaching 
1 CONC from the terminus at Hunter-street. A Waverley tramcar waa coming at the 
1 CONC time from an opposite direction, and as Mr. Oakes did not appear to get 
1 CONC out of the way quickly enough, the driver of the motor attached to the 
1 CONC approaching tramcars gave him a push. Through some means, Mr. Oakes 
1 CONC tripped, and fell forward heavily upon his head on the roadway, and when 
1 CONC picked up he was found to be insensible. He waa immediately conveyed to 
1 CONC the in- firmary, and every means was resorted to in order to restore him 
1 CONC to consciousness, but without avail, the unfortunate gentleman ex- piring 
1 CONC two hours afterwards, never having gained consciousness after his fall.
1 CONT
1 CONT The hon. gentleman, who was 68 years of age, was one of the oldest 
1 CONC members of the Council. He was a native of Parramatta, and a large landed 
1 CONC proprietor. For many years past he has been extensively associated with 
1 CONC pastoral pursuits. On the afternoon of the accident he proceeded to the 
1 CONC Council to hear Mr. Dalley'a address against passing the Chinese 
1 CONC Restriction Bill.

1 CONC BOOTH, ANGELA ELIZABETH JOSEPHINE (1869-1954), eugenicist, was born on 27 
1 CONC October 1869 at Liverpool, Lancashire, England, and registered as 
1 CONC Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Plover, labourer, and his illiterate wife 
1 CONC Eliza, n�e Hall. Despite her humble origins, Elizabeth claimed to have 
1 CONC been educated at Liverpool and 'on the Continent'. In 1896 she migrated 
1 CONC to Australia and on 7 January 1897, styling herself Angela Elizabeth 
1 CONC Josephine, married a medical practitioner and divorcee James Booth 
1 CONC (1861-1944) at St Andrew's Anglican Cathedral, Sydney.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1901 the Booths moved to Broken Hill where they took a keen interest 
1 CONC in community affairs: James served as a non-Labor alderman (1909-16), 
1 CONC founded the local art gallery and co-founded the Broken Hill Nursing 
1 CONC Society. Angela was concerned with the role that women might take to 
1 CONC improve social and political conditions: she joined the Women's Political 
1 CONC Association and the Liberal Education Society, and addressed audiences on 
1 CONC the need for women to participate in public life.
1 CONT
1 CONT Shortly before World War I the Booths settled in North Melbourne where 
1 CONC Angela involved herself in the middle-class, activist community. 
1 CONC Resigning from the W.P.A. in 1915 in protest against its pacifist stance, 
1 CONC she supported conscription and saw the war as morally correct. Like many 
1 CONC others, however, she was alarmed at the spread of venereal diseases and 
1 CONC wanted to rebuild a stable and healthy postwar society.
1 CONT
1 CONT In her writing and lecturing Booth held that the wise management of 
1 CONC sexuality was essential. A dedicated eugenicist, she called for the 
1 CONC eradication of venereal diseases, the elimination of prostitution and the 
1 CONC planned birth of healthy, wanted children. During World War I she had 
1 CONC founded the Association to Combat the Social Evil and delivered an 
1 CONC address on prostitution to a large Workers' Educational Association 
1 CONC conference in Sydney. Optimistic that the 'sex problem' could be remedied 
1 CONC by social reform, she maintained that women were forced into prostitution 
1 CONC through economic necessity and that prostitution was encouraged by a 
1 CONC double standard of morality. Booth's solution was threefold. Women must 
1 CONC receive equal pay; they must become active in government; and the public 
1 CONC must be educated in 'racial responsibility': sexual restraint and planned 
1 CONC parenthood would lead to a better society.
1 CONT
1 CONT While her husband was president of the Australian Literature Society 
1 CONC (1927) and of the Playlovers' Club (1929), Angela was politically active 
1 CONC as a conservative. President of the North Melbourne branch of the 
1 CONC National Federation and a leading member of both the Australian Women's 
1 CONC National League and the Women's Citizen Movement, she enjoyed the support 
1 CONC of such groups as the Housewives' Association. She was councillor 
1 CONC (1926-33) for the Warrandyte riding of the Doncaster and Templestowe 
1 CONC shire where the Booths owned a property, Nilga. In 1927 she was appointed 
1 CONC a justice of the peace. Later that year she unsuccessfully sought 
1 CONC Nationalist endorsement for State parliament and in 1929 failed to win 
1 CONC the Legislative Assembly seat of Brighton as an Independent Nationalist. 
1 CONC In her campaigns she urged women to vote together, believing that the 
1 CONC concerns uniting them were more important than party politics.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Depression seriously damaged Angela's faith in liberal reform. Rather 
1 CONC than criticizing the capitalist system, she grew convinced that the 
1 CONC alleged proliferation of 'mental defectives' in society was the greatest 
1 CONC single cause of unemployment and crime. From the late 1920s the Booths 
1 CONC argued that legislation should be enacted to provide for 'the 
1 CONC sterilisation of the unfit'. As chairman of the North Melbourne 
1 CONC Children's Court, James introduced psychological testing of delinquents. 
1 CONC He warned that 'Moron breeds Moron'. The Booths met like-minded reformers 
1 CONC through the Racial Hygiene Association of New South Wales.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1936 James and Angela became founding members of the Eugenics Society 
1 CONC of Victoria, a body which included prominent citizens dedicated to the 
1 CONC promotion of selective breeding. In its early years Angela served as the 
1 CONC society's vice-president. With its president W. E. Agar, she was one of 
1 CONC the group's major proponents of sterilization, which she presented as an 
1 CONC altruistic operation to spare the unfit from the burden of parenthood and 
1 CONC to protect society from racial degeneration. In 1938 the Eugenics Society 
1 CONC published her lecture, Voluntary Sterilization for Human Betterment, a 
1 CONC policy for which it unsuccessfully lobbied the Victorian government next 
1 CONC year.
1 CONT
1 CONT Following James's death in 1944, Angela remained on Nilga. Age and 
1 CONC distance curbed her activities. She returned to Melbourne about 1950 to 
1 CONC live at Toorak and later at Sandringham where she died on 5 September 
1 CONC 1954 and was cremated. A stepdaughter survived her.

1 CONT
1 CONT Angela Elizabeth Josephine Booth (1869-1954), sex educator, was born at 
1 CONC Liverpool, England, daughter of Thomas Plover, a labourer, and his wife. 
1 CONC Little is known of her early life. She emigrated to Queensland in 1896 
1 CONC and on 7 January 1897 married James Booth, medical practitioner and a 
1 CONC widower [incorrect, divorced] with two daughters. The Booths moved to 
1 CONC Broken Hill in 1901 and to Melbourne in 1914. While in Broken Hill, 
1 CONC Angela began her campaign to eradicate venereal disease, which was to 
1 CONC remain a central concern in a life devoted to reform. She condemned the 
1 CONC moral double standard and the condoning of prostitution, and her analysis 
1 CONC of the problem went beyond that to the economics of dependency. She was a 
1 CONC strong advocate of equal pay: when women were no longer 'forced' to hook 
1 CONC a man, prostitution would cease to be a social problem.
1 CONT
1 CONT Mrs Booth was drawn by the logic of her own arguments to asserting 
1 CONC women's right to good education and political and legal equality. During 
1 CONC the height of the wartime scare that soldiers' movements would spread VD 
1 CONC in epidemic proportions, she achieved notoriety by speaking out against 
1 CONC condoms being made readily available. It would encourage promiscuity when 
1 CONC what was needed was to change male attitudes, she said. She was a 
1 CONC founding member of the Association to Combat the Social Evil and a 
1 CONC speaker at a conference on sexual hygiene in 1916.
1 CONT
1 CONT She became a proponent of 'racial responsibility' and a member of the 
1 CONC Racial Hygiene Association which advocated family planning and 
1 CONC established the first family planning clinic in New South Wales. The 
1 CONC sterilisation of the mentally impaired, which was an aspect of 'racial 
1 CONC hygiene', attracted more press notice than her reasoned arguments for 
1 CONC protecting women's health. Her last publication Voluntary Sterilisation 
1 CONC for Human Betterment (1938) was a plea to legalise surgical procedures 
1 CONC for sterilisation.
1 CONT
1 CONT Mrs Booth was a member of the Australian Women's National League and a 
1 CONC life executive member from 1931. She was elected councillor in 1926 for 
1 CONC the Warrandyte riding in the shire of Doncaster and Templestowe and was 
1 CONC returned in successive elections until 1933. In 1929 she stood as an 
1 CONC independent Nationalist for the state seat of Brighton on a platform 
1 CONC which featured sound finance and 'organisation against unemployment', but 
1 CONC no policies specially directed to the problems of women though she 
1 CONC described herself in her election literature as the founder of the 
1 CONC Association to Combat the Social Evil, and as lecturer and writer on 
1 CONC sociological subjects. She was not elected.
1 CONT
1 CONT Appointed a justice of the peace in 1927 (among the first women so 
1 CONC appointed in Victoria), Angela Booth became more involved in the work of 
1 CONC the Children's Court. Distressed by the evidence of mental problems among 
1 CONC children appearing in court, she urged routine testing for mental 
1 CONC deficiency and a more 'scientific' approach in the treatment of state 
1 CONC wards.
1 CONT
1 CONT She was widowed in 1944 and died in 1954. Angela Booth was ahead of her 
1 CONC time in her analysis of sexual politics. From her condemnation of beauty 
1 CONC parades in 1927 as commercial exploitation of women, to her arguments on 
1 CONC the importance of education and equal pay if women were no longer to be 
1 CONC exposed to sexual exploitation, she was voicing in the 1920s the analysis 
1 CONC of the 1970s, but in a terminology since debased by the linking of 
1 CONC genocide to eugenics. For Mrs Booth, the crux of eugenics was planned 
1 CONC pregnancy.

1 CONC Dr Hedley Woods (decd) forwarded to her all his research as at that time 
1 CONC he was getting past the ability to travel into Sydney etc.   In these 
1 CONC notes he says that our Edward had a brother William.   William 1771-1826 
1 CONC was a first fleet convict and eventually settled at Wilberforce where he 
1 CONC was granted 25 acres in 1794.
1 CONT   
1 CONT He was tried and convicted of highway robbery in Winchester on the 
1 CONC 29/7/1783 and was transported for seven years on the ship Friendship.  At 
1 CONC that time there was a recession in the clothing industry etc and the 
1 CONC authorities were recruiting in that area for the N.S.W. Corps so that may 
1 CONC have been how our Edward ended up in the Corps.   There is also mention 
1 CONC in a book in the Genealogical Society on the N.S.W.  Corps 1788-1810 
1 CONC published by the University of Bristol, West of England, that most of the 
1 CONC recruits were from farming families.

1 CONT In 1806 William settled at The Ponds (I believe that this is near the Cox 
1 CONC land between Richmond and Windsor) and she said that she was told that he 
1 CONC was also buried in the Castlereagh Cemetery, however, she has not been 
1 CONC able to prove this. [Note by GW - ref. Watkin Tench's book "1788" on page 
1 CONC 219 which shows that William Field was living at The Ponds in December 
1 CONC 1791].
1 CONT   
1 CONT This convict William married in 1790 Elizabeth Robinson and later when he 
1 CONC was living at the Ponds he was with Margaret Cawthorne (or some name like 
1 CONC that).
1 CONT   
1 CONT There are two persons named William Field who died in 1826.  One died on 
1 CONC the 22/10/1826 and he was 64 years old at date of death so that would 
1 CONC make his d.o.b. 1762 not 1771 as Headley Woods indicated.
1 CONT   
1 CONT Pan would be interested in any research and facts that anyone can find 
1 CONC would welcome you phoning her if you have any queries after you have 
1 CONC looked into the above.
1 CONT   
1 CONT Meanwhile, she gave me an address that we both used some long time ago.  
1 CONC There was Devises couple who were compiling a book detailing as much 
1 CONC information as possible on the convicts from Wiltshire who were sent to 
1 CONC Australia.  I do not know if they will still be alive but I have written 
1 CONC to them and also to the municipal library to see if any of their research 
1 CONC has been lodged with them.
1 CONT   
1 CONT There was, as we know, a Sgt William Field but she thinks that he and his 
1 CONC family settled in the Newcastle area and makes no claim of a family 
1 CONC connection.
1 CONT   
1 CONT Pan also mentioned a H.J.Rumsay who indicates in some writing that can be 
1 CONC found in the Genealogical Society that William Field 1771-1826 was "said 
1 CONC to be a brother to Edward Field".    As Rumsay did a lot of research into 
1 CONC this area of our history I find this statement to be interesting.

1 CONC Prolific Australian poet, critic, and short-story writer, who published 
1 CONC more than 56 volumes of poetry and short stories. Judith Wright, whose 
1 CONC work was deeply rooted in the landscape of her native Australia, was an 
1 CONC uncompromising environmentalist and social activist campaigning for 
1 CONC Aboriginal land rights. She believed that the poet should be concerned 
1 CONC with national and social problems. At the age of 85, just before her 
1 CONC death, she attended in Canberra a march for reconciliation with 
1 CONC Aboriginal people. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Rhyme, my old cymbal, 
1 CONT I don't clash you as often, 
1 CONT or trust your old promises 
1 CONT music and unison. 
1 CONT I used to love Keats, Blake; 
1 CONT now I try haiku 
1 CONT for its honed brevities, 
1 CONT its inclusive silences. 
1 CONT (from 'Brevity' in Notes at Edge) 
1 CONT
1 CONT Judith Arundell Wright was born near Armidale, New South Wales, into an 
1 CONC old and wealthy pastoral family. Later she wrote of her family 
1 CONC affectionally in The Generations of Men (1959). Wright was raised on her 
1 CONC family's sheep station. After the death of her mother in 1927, she was 
1 CONC educated under the supervision of her relatives. At the age of 14, after 
1 CONC her father remarried, she was sent to New England Girls' Scool, where she 
1 CONC found consolation in poetry, publishing in 1933 her first poem. In 1934 
1 CONC she entered Sydney University, where she studied philosophy, history, 
1 CONC psychology and English, without taking a degree. 
1 CONT
1 CONT When Wright was in her 20s, she became progressively deaf. Between the 
1 CONC years 1937 and 1938, she travelled in Britain and Europe. She then worked 
1 CONC as a secretary-stenographer and clerk until 1944. From 1944 to 1948 she 
1 CONC was a university statistician at the University of Queensland, St. Lucia. 
1 CONC At the age of 3,0 Wright met her lifelong partner, the unorthodox 
1 CONC philosopher J.P. McKinney, 23 years her senior; they later married. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Most of Wright's poetry was written in the mountains of southern 
1 CONC Queensland. Protesting the policy of Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Premier of 
1 CONC Queensland, Wright left her home state in the mid-1970s, and settled in a 
1 CONC remote property near the heritage town of Braidwood, south of Canberra, 
1 CONC where she wrote many of her later nature poems. 
1 CONT
1 CONT During her career as a writer, Wright did not reject hack work, school 
1 CONC plays for Australian Broadcasting Comission or children's books, as a 
1 CONC means of livlihood. She lectured part-time at various Australian 
1 CONC universities. In 1975 she published a collection of her addresses and 
1 CONC speeches in Because I was Invited. Wright was appointed a foundation 
1 CONC fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and an emeritus 
1 CONC professor of the Literature Board of the Arts Council of Australia. 
1 CONC Wright's memoir, Half a Lifetime (2000), covered her life until the 
1 CONC 1960s. Wright died of a heart attack in Canberra on June 26, at the age 
1 CONC of 85. Her ashes were scattered around the mountain cemetery of Tamborine 
1 CONC Mountain. Wright had owned a strip of rainforest nearby, which she 
1 CONC donated to the state so it could be preserved as a national park. Her 
1 CONC daughter Meredith McKinney edited with Patricia Clarke a selection of 
1 CONC letters by the author and Jack McKinney, entitled The Equal Heart and 
1 CONC Mind (2004). 
1 CONT
1 CONT Wright started to publish poems in the late 1930s in literary journals, 
1 CONC such as Sydney Morning Herald, Bulletin, and Meanjin Papers. She made her 
1 CONC debut in 1946 with The Moving Image, in which she showed her technical 
1 CONC excellence free from the burden of fashionable trends. Most of the poems 
1 CONC were written in wartime - in 'The Trains' Wright took the threat of the 
1 CONC war in the Pacific as her subject. The main theme was the poet's 
1 CONC awareness of time, death, and evil on a universal scale. With the 
1 CONC following collections Wright gained a reputation as a wholly new voice in 
1 CONC literature, with a distinctly female perspective. The title poem from 
1 CONC Woman to Man (1949) dealt with the sexual act from a woman's point of 
1 CONC view. 'The Maker' paralleled the creation of a poem and the creation of a 
1 CONC child. Several of her early works such as 'Bullocky' and 'Woman to Man' 
1 CONC became standard anthology pieces. Wright also wrote love poems to her 
1 CONC husband. His death in 1966 and her increasing anxiety over the 
1 CONC destruction of the natural environment introduced more pessimistic 
1 CONC undercurrents in her work. 
1 CONT
1 CONT I praise the scoring drought, the flying dust 
1 CONT the drying creek, the furious animal, 
1 CONT that they oppose us still; 
1 CONT that we are ruined by the thing we kill. 
1 CONT (from 'Australia 1970') 
1 CONT
1 CONT Wright's lyrical work was inspired by the various regions in which she 
1 CONC lived: New England, New South Wales, the subtropical rainforests of 
1 CONC Tamborine Mountain, Queensland, and the plains of the southern highlands 
1 CONC near Braidwood. T.S. Eliot's influence can be seen in Phantom Dwelling 
1 CONC (1985); other poets that influenced her were Wallace Stevens and W.B. 
1 CONC Yeats. 
1 CONT
1 CONT A new period in Wright's life started in the mid-1950s: "The two threads 
1 CONC of my life, the love of the land itself and the deep unease over the fate 
1 CONC of its original people, were beginning to twine together, and the rest of 
1 CONC my life would be influenced by that connection." In The Two Faces (1955) 
1 CONC she took Hiroshima as an example of man's power to destroy even the 
1 CONC cycles of nature. Wright's activism on conservation issues led her to 
1 CONC focus on the interaction between land and the language. According to 
1 CONC Wright, "the true function of art and culture is to interpret us to 
1 CONC ourselves, and to relate us to the country and the society in which we 
1 CONC live." She started to see that her mission was to find words and poetic 
1 CONC forms to bridge the human experience and the natural world, man and 
1 CONC earth. "Poetry needs a background in which emotional, as well as material 
1 CONC values are given their due weight; and the effect of this shallowness of 
1 CONC roots is easily traceable in Australian writing, with its uneasy attempts 
1 CONC to solve or to ignore the problem of its attitude to the country." 
1 CONC Alienation from the land meant for Wright crisis of the language. She 
1 CONC criticized the education system for failing to teach students the 
1 CONC pleasures of poetry, and promoted the reading and writing of poetry in 
1 CONC schools. Realistically, she also expressed doubts about the power of 
1 CONC poetry to change the scheme of things. 
1 CONT
1 CONT In the early 1960s, Wright helped to found Wildlife Preservation Society 
1 CONC of Queensland. She fought to conserve the Great Barrier Reef, when its 
1 CONC ecology was threatened by oil drilling, and campaigned against sand 
1 CONC mining on Fraser Island. In her passionate poem 'Australia 1970' Wright 
1 CONC expressed her feelings of disappointment and anger, seeing her wild 
1 CONC country die, "like the eaglehawk, / dangerous till the last breath�s 
1 CONC gone, clawing and / striking." The Coral Battleground (1977) was her 
1 CONC account of the campaign to protect the "great water-gardens, lovely 
1 CONC indeed as cherry boughs and flowers under the once clear sea.� In The Cry 
1 CONC for the Dead (1981) Wright examined the treatment of Aborigines and 
1 CONC destruction of the environment by settlers in Central Queensland from the 
1 CONC 1840s to the 1920s. In 1991 she resigned as patron of the Wildlife 
1 CONC Preservation Society because of its failure to support Aboriginal land 
1 CONC rights. 
1 CONT
1 CONT As a literary critic Wright enjoyed a high reputation, and edited several 
1 CONC collections of Australian verse. She was a friend of the Aboriginal poet 
1 CONC Oodgeroo Noonuccal, whose work Wright helped to get published. 
1 CONC Preoccupations in Australian Poetry (1965) was Wright's pioneering effort 
1 CONC to reread such early Australian poets as Charles Harpur, Adam Lindsay 
1 CONC Gordon, and Henry Kendall.

1 CONC Meredith McKinney edited with Patricia Clarke a selection of letters by 
1 CONC the author and Jack McKinney, entitled The Equal Heart and Mind (2004). 
1 CONT
1 CONT Judith Wright's daughter thought she knew all the family's secrets, 
1 CONC writes Steve Meacham.
1 CONT
1 CONT AS FIVE-YEAR-OLD Meredith McKinney headed off to her first day at primary 
1 CONC school, her mother - the poet, environmentalist and activist Judith 
1 CONC Wright - had a heart-to-heart with the little girl.
1 CONT
1 CONT There was something Meredith should know, the poet said. Although her 
1 CONC mother went by the name of McKinney, she wasn't actually married to Jack 
1 CONC McKinney, a philosopher and playwright 25 years her senior. McKinney had 
1 CONC been married when they met and his wife wouldn't grant him a divorce. 
1 CONC That meant Meredith was illegitimate. And in the 1950s that was still 
1 CONC considered a stain.
1 CONT
1 CONT "She told me in anticipation of problems I would have at school," says 
1 CONC McKinney, an only child born when her mother was 35. "Obviously she 
1 CONC considered it an issue. She had changed her name by deed poll before I 
1 CONC was born in an effort to make me seem legitimate."
1 CONT
1 CONT McKinney, now 55, thought she knew all the skeletons in her family 
1 CONC closet, but it was only when she read her mother's letters for a new book 
1 CONC that she realised the family passions ran deep.
1 CONT
1 CONT With Love and Fury is the second volume of Judith Wright's letters, 
1 CONC co-edited by McKinney and the literary historian Patricia Clarke. The 
1 CONC first book, The Equal Heart and Mind - published in 2004, four years 
1 CONC after the poet's death at 85 - dealt with the love letters between Wright 
1 CONC and the man she was eventually able to marry in 1964, two years before 
1 CONC Jack McKinney's death.
1 CONT
1 CONT This second book focuses primarily on Wright's letters to friends, 
1 CONC relatives and literary colleagues, including Barbara Blackman, John 
1 CONC Blight and Rosemary Dobson. For McKinney, the most revelatory letters 
1 CONC were those between her mother and her maternal grandfather, the 
1 CONC pastoralist Phillip Arundel Wright. She hadn't seen them before. "And 
1 CONC they made it much clearer what all the family kerfuffle was. Her father 
1 CONC was upset on all sorts of levels by what she was doing. That she had gone 
1 CONC off with a man twice her age. That he was already married. That he was 
1 CONC the wrong class.
1 CONT
1 CONT "That was a big issue for my grandfather. My father was a drover whereas 
1 CONC my grandfather was a grazier. There's one letter my mother wrote to my 
1 CONC father which I hadn't read before. It was written after she had revealed 
1 CONC the relationship [to McKinney's grandfather] and talked about how he had 
1 CONC cried. And there is a set of letters written to my grandfather around the 
1 CONC time I was born in which she seemed to be trying to placate him in every 
1 CONC way possible."
1 CONT
1 CONT After the birth, things apparently settled down, presumably - McKinney 
1 CONC says - because her grandfather didn't want to risk estranging daughter 
1 CONC and granddaughter. "The only thing I was aware of as a child was a 
1 CONC tension between my father and my mother's family. They were polite to him 
1 CONC rather than warm."
1 CONT
1 CONT McKinney, a translator, began sorting through her mother's prodigious 
1 CONC correspondence within a year of her death. Yes, she admits, reading about 
1 CONC your mother's innermost emotions from years before might seem a bizarre 
1 CONC thing to do. But "it's an impulse a lot of people have when a parent has 
1 CONC died - to go back over their life and try to make sense of it. It was 
1 CONC hugely revealing. An emotional journey."
1 CONT
1 CONT Her mother had left a collection of letters to the National Library of 
1 CONC Australia, which is publishing With Love and Fury. "But there were very 
1 CONC few private letters." For that, they had to approach the recipients.
1 CONT
1 CONT The result, McKinney says, is a unique, first-person insight into a 
1 CONC multifaceted individual that provides "a sense of the whole woman: the 
1 CONC poet, the environmental activist, the indigenous rights activist - and 
1 CONC how they all fitted into her life".
1 CONT
1 CONT What emerges "is the sense of trajectory about her life. For me, the 
1 CONC letters reveal the very strong shift in her life, from being a private 
1 CONC person and a poet to a public person and an activist. And it coincides 
1 CONC pretty exactly with the moment I went off to boarding school around the 
1 CONC age of 12, which I found a shock.
1 CONT
1 CONT "The moment I was off her hands she just turned around and got on with 
1 CONC her next job, which was going out into the world and start fighting for 
1 CONC the things she loved. Within a month she was getting into new things."
1 CONT
1 CONT Wright's new focus interrupted her poetic productivity. But McKinney says 
1 CONC the letters Wright wrote to Blight, a fellow poet, reveal a more complex 
1 CONC story. "As I was reading those letters I realised that the muse, as it 
1 CONC were, was not a constant thing with her. Even earlier on there were times 
1 CONC when the muse seemed to be withdrawing and her energies were wanting to 
1 CONC be in other places."
1 CONT
1 CONT The poems she did write after she became an environmental activist were 
1 CONC markedly different.
1 CONT
1 CONT "The poetry she used to write had been strongly lyrical. What began to 
1 CONC emerge, increasingly, was a powerful speaking voice. It used free verse 
1 CONC and didn't strive for the rhymes and rhythms she had before. It spoke 
1 CONC directly to the reader and spoke more directly of the world rather than 
1 CONC the inner being."
1 CONT
1 CONT So which style does her daughter prefer? "I love them both, but I like 
1 CONC the later ones because I can hear her so strongly. I think it's a great 
1 CONC achievement to be able to write a good poem in your real voice." As for 
1 CONC her favourite poem, McKinney cites Lament for Passenger Pigeons.
1 CONT
1 CONT "I like it because it seems to have brought together all the things which 
1 CONC were in her. It's strongly lyrical. It has that ecstatic understanding of 
1 CONC things as the basis for it. It's a late poem and it is talking directly 
1 CONC about our destruction of the world - the great theme of her later years. 
1 CONC And, of course, a great theme of ours today."
1 CONT
1 CONT Wright's later years - spent at The Edge, her property outside Braidwood 
1 CONC - were not easy. She was nearly blind and completely deaf, but still 
1 CONC wrote letters because she could touch-type. They reveal, McKinney says, 
1 CONC "a surprising cheerfulness, considering the dire nature of what she had 
1 CONC been warning about for 20 years. Her smile began to reappear."

1 CONC CARR-GLYN, NEVA JOSEPHINE MARY (1908-1975), actress, was born on 10 May 
1 CONC 1908 in Melbourne, daughter of Adolphus Benjamin Carr Glynn (d.1923), an 
1 CONC Irish-born vaudevillian known as 'Arthur Glynn', and his wife Marie 
1 CONC Dunoon, n�e Senior, late Mola, a singer from Scotland. Travelling with 
1 CONC her parents, Neva (aged 4) appeared as Little Willie in East Lynne (with 
1 CONC her mother 'Marie Avis'), and was 'in and out of convents all over 
1 CONC Australia'. In Sydney she learned ballet at Minnie Hooper's dancing 
1 CONC academy. She left school at 14 and made the back line of the chorus in 
1 CONC the Fullers' pantomime, Dick Whittington and his Cat, at the Majestic 
1 CONC Theatre in December 1923, then toured until late 1924 with the Band Box 
1 CONC Revue.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Given a five-year contract as a 'utility' by Sir Benjamin Fuller, Neva 
1 CONC found the work gruelling, though 'it was wonderful training'. She was 
1 CONC constantly busy: principal girl in Robinson Crusoe (1925-26), in 
1 CONC vaudeville with Jim Gerald and George Wallace, principal boy in Aladdin 
1 CONC at the Majestic (1927-28), and with Roy Rene in Clowns in Clover 
1 CONC (December 1929). In January 1930 she left on a tour of South Africa with 
1 CONC the Frank Neil Company, during which she had leading roles in feathery 
1 CONC comedies.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT In London in January 1931 Neva was given the second lead in the operetta, 
1 CONC Nina Rosa. She was well connected through her mother (a sister of Lady 
1 CONC Coombe) and was a cousin of the actress 'Carol' Coombe. Imperious, with 
1 CONC 'a dark, rather exotic grace', strong features and flashing, blue eyes, 
1 CONC Neva temporarily dyed her raven hair because there were more parts for 
1 CONC blondes. Joining Leslie Henson's company in 1931, she performed in such 
1 CONC plays as Living Dangerously (1934), Accidentally Yours (1935) and Aren't 
1 CONC Men Beasts? (1936). At the register office, Paddington, on 7 August 1936 
1 CONC she married Arthur William John, a private secretary from Australia; they 
1 CONC were soon to be divorced. She also appeared in four films, including The 
1 CONC Squeaker (1937) for (Sir) Alexander Korda.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Neva returned to Sydney in September 1937 and joined Gerald at the 
1 CONC Tivoli. Under contract to the Australian Broadcasting Commission from 
1 CONC mid-1938 until her release in April 1941, she worked extremely long hours 
1 CONC and starred (often with Peter Finch) in countless radio plays, among them 
1 CONC 'Toad of Toad Hall' and Max Afford's detective serial, 'Greyface'. She 
1 CONC missed contact with the audience and the excitement of the theatre, but 
1 CONC found radio to be 'a serious art with a fascination all its own', 
1 CONC requiring 'twice the sincerity necessary in stage acting'.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT At St Mark's Anglican Church, Darling Point, on 19 July 1940 Neva married 
1 CONC a fellow actor John Paul Tate; their son Nick was born in 1942. They 
1 CONC lived at Darling Point, acquired a cottage at Mona Vale and spent their 
1 CONC spare time 'messing about in boats'. Developing 'fine teamwork', Neva and 
1 CONC John appeared together in numerous radio plays (such as Victoria Regina) 
1 CONC and serials (including Edmund Barclay's 'As Ye Sow'). A star in 'Lux 
1 CONC Radio Theatre' and for Macquarie Broadcasting Services Pty Ltd, she won 
1 CONC Macquarie awards for the best actress in 1950 and 1951. Throughout the 
1 CONC 1940s Neva was also leading lady at the Minerva Theatre. The Tates toured 
1 CONC New Zealand in 1944 with J. C. Williamson Ltd; Arsenic and Old Lace was 
1 CONC in the repertoire. In August 1950 they appeared at the Theatre Royal, 
1 CONC Hobart, for Fifi Banvard.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1951-52 Neva toured Australia with the John Alden Company, 
1 CONC playing�among other Shakespearian roles�Portia in The Merchant of Venice 
1 CONC and Titania in A Midsummer Night's Dream. Her marriage ended in divorce 
1 CONC in 1954. She appeared in The Shifting Heart for the Australian 
1 CONC Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1957 and, joining the Trust Players in 1959, 
1 CONC was acclaimed as Oola (written for her by Peter Kenna) in The Slaughter 
1 CONC of St. Teresa's Day.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Living alone from 1965, with a dog her only companion, Neva was tired of 
1 CONC touring. In the 1960s she appeared with the Old Tote Theatre Company and 
1 CONC the Marian Street Theatre, in films, in television programmes that ranged 
1 CONC from 'Skippy' to 'Homicide', in the A.B.C. radio serial, 'Blue Hills', 
1 CONC and even with a professional group that performed at clubs. She played 
1 CONC Mrs Gillipop for four years in the children's television show, 'The 
1 CONC Gillipops'. A battler afflicted with a severe limp, she was increasingly 
1 CONC type-cast as 'bizarre harridan-like women', as in the film (1967) of 
1 CONC Norman Lindsay's Age of Consent. After missing a rehearsal for the A.B.C. 
1 CONC television serial 'Certain Women', on 10 August 1975 she was found to 
1 CONC have died of a cerebral haemorrhage at her Mona Vale home. Survived by 
1 CONC her son, she was cremated. Neva Carr-Glyn was considered by her peers to 
1 CONC be one of Australia's best actresses, able to handle both drama and 
1 CONC sophisticated comedy with telling effect.

1 CONC CHAPPLE, PHOEBE (1879-1967), medical practitioner, was born on 31 March 
1 CONC 1879 in Adelaide, youngest daughter of Frederic Chapple and his wife 
1 CONC Elizabeth Sarah, n�e Hunter. Educated at the Advanced School for Girls, 
1 CONC she entered the University of Adelaide at 16 (B.Sc., 1898; M.B., B.S., 
1 CONC 1904). In 1905 she was a house-surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital and later 
1 CONC worked for a time at the Sydney Medical Mission. Until 1914 she practised 
1 CONC from her father's school, Prince Alfred College, attending the boarders 
1 CONC and travelling in a phaeton driven by a liveried coachman when visiting 
1 CONC patients.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Dr Chapple, a feminist, was one of a handful of Australian medical women 
1 CONC who served in World War I. The army refused to appoint female doctors, so 
1 CONC she left Adelaide in February 1917 for England and became attached first 
1 CONC to the Royal Army Medical Corps and later to Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary 
1 CONC Corps, although women were not accorded formal military status. Her first 
1 CONC appointment was as surgeon at Cambridge Hospital, Aldershot. In November 
1 CONC she went to France where she worked with the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps 
1 CONC at Abbeville till August 1918 and also at Rouen and Le Havre. On the 
1 CONC night of 29 May 1918 she was inspecting the women's camps when, because 
1 CONC of intense bombing, she and forty women sheltered in trenches. A direct 
1 CONC hit killed nine and injured several others. For 'gallantry and devotion 
1 CONC to duty' on this occasion, Dr Chapple received the rare award for a woman 
1 CONC of the Military Medal. Like most of her contemporaries, she tolerated 
1 CONC military conservatism but was aware that women were '[squeezed] dry like 
1 CONC an orange'.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT She returned to Australia in 1919 and resumed practice, on North Terrace, 
1 CONC until 1937. Supported by the Women's Non-Party Association, Dr Chapple 
1 CONC was narrowly defeated in the 1919 Adelaide municipal elections. In 
1 CONC 1921-22 she was honorary medical officer, night clinic (venereal 
1 CONC diseases), for women patients at the Adelaide Hospital. For about thirty 
1 CONC years from 1910 she was honorary doctor at the Salvation Army maternity 
1 CONC hospital for unmarried mothers, first at Carrington Street, Adelaide, 
1 CONC then at McBride Hospital, Medindie. 'She was a courageous and clever 
1 CONC obstetrician � but was jealous of her authority'; although untiring in 
1 CONC her work, she never involved herself in the adoption of patients' babies 
1 CONC or their non-medical problems.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT On the last of her six overseas trips, in 1937 she was the Australian 
1 CONC delegate to the Medical Women's International Association conference in 
1 CONC Edinburgh. She continued her practice from her home in Norwood until she 
1 CONC was 85. She was known as 'Auntie Doc' by her large family whom she kept 
1 CONC together and in touch. She was blunt, confident, dominating. A tall 
1 CONC strong woman, for years she headed the nursing units marching each Anzac 
1 CONC Day. She died unmarried on 24 March 1967 and was cremated with full 
1 CONC military honours. Her estate was sworn for probate at $93,910; St Ann's 
1 CONC College, University of Adelaide, received a bursary from it which is 
1 CONC administered in her name.

1 CONC CHAPPLE, FREDERIC (1845-1924), headmaster, was born on 12 October 1845 at 
1 CONC St Pancras, London, son of John Chapple, mason, and his wife Louisa, n�e 
1 CONC Brewin. He studied at King's College, University of London (B.A., 1870; 
1 CONC B.Sc., 1873) and at Westminster College, a Wesleyan teacher-training 
1 CONC institution where he later taught for five years. He was a founding 
1 CONC member of the National Union of Elementary Teachers, which he represented 
1 CONC in 1870 at a congress on the desirability of religious teaching in 
1 CONC government schools. It was a cause he was to espouse again in South 
1 CONC Australia. During this period he declined appointment as principal of a 
1 CONC Wesleyan university in Illinois, United States of America.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1876 Chapple agreed to succeed J. A. Hartley as headmaster of Prince 
1 CONC Alfred College and arrived in Adelaide on 8 April. An early achievement 
1 CONC was to secure in 1878 the incorporation of the school. This removed its 
1 CONC financial control from 'the hands of four or five gentlemen who might do 
1 CONC as they liked' and vested it in a board of management. He continued to 
1 CONC shift the school's emphasis away from classical subjects and towards 
1 CONC mathematics and natural science, aiming to broaden the boys' minds. 
1 CONC Chapple considered that colleges such as Prince Alfred were 'freer' than 
1 CONC state schools to devote themselves to 'education' as distinct from 
1 CONC 'instruction'. As president of the Collegiate Masters' Association, he 
1 CONC told the 1881-83 commission on the working of the education Acts, that 
1 CONC provision by the state of advanced or secondary education for 'the 
1 CONC people' would be 'a very perilous experiment' and should not be 'one of 
1 CONC the functions of government'.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT Chapple played an active community role outside the school: he was warden 
1 CONC of the Senate of the University of Adelaide in 1883-1922, vice-president 
1 CONC of the Royal Society of South Australia in 1880-81, president of the 
1 CONC Literary Societies' Union and vice-president of the South Australian 
1 CONC branch of the Teachers' Guild of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1900 he 
1 CONC published The Boy's Own Grammar � and he supported Our Boys' Institute, 
1 CONC the State athletic association, and the Young Men's Christian Association 
1 CONC of Adelaide of which he was president for seven years. He impressed his 
1 CONC contemporaries as being a man of energy and whimsicality and 
1 CONC pre-eminently of a 'simple, earnest religious faith'. A Methodist, he was 
1 CONC a president of the Council of Churches and, on leave in England in 1901, 
1 CONC was a delegate to the Methodist Ecumenical Conference.
1 CONT
1 CONT
1 CONT On 16 April 1870 at Bethnal Green, London, Chapple had married Elizabeth 
1 CONC Sarah Hunter, a schoolmistress. They took great pride in the excellent 
1 CONC academic achievements of their four daughters and four sons. Phoebe was 
1 CONC an intrepid medical doctor. On Chapple's retirement at the end of 1914 he 
1 CONC was appointed C.M.G. It was said by a successor, J. F. Ward, that Chapple 
1 CONC had been 'the man who really founded Prince Alfred College as a great 
1 CONC school'. He died on 29 February 1924 at his home in Norwood and was 
1 CONC buried in West Terrace cemetery. A bronze bust by G. A. Barnes is in the 
1 CONC school's Old Assembly Hall.

1 CONC [Woolls and Descendants again.FTW]
1 CONT
1 CONT Rev William Woolls Rutledge was named after the founder of The Kings 
1 CONC School, Rev William Woolls, with whom James was acquainted as a teacher 
1 CONC at that school.  
1 CONT
1 CONT W W Rutledge was first a journalist and at one stage he was on the staff 
1 CONC of "The Empire", a paper edited by Sir Henry Parkes.  Later he was editor 
1 CONC of the "Newcastle Chronicle" from which he retired to enter the 
1 CONC ministry.  He became a Methodist clergyman and at the time of his second 
1 CONC marriage to Clara Moore on 2 May 1888, he was minister at Mudgee.
1 CONT
1 CONT His daughter Kathleen wrote of him in her diary "Father had a fine 
1 CONC personality, a good brain, intellectual, a good businessman with 
1 CONC organizing ability.  With all this he was kind, courteous and friendly.  
1 CONC Also a fine preacher.  He possessed a beautiful baritone voice.  In his 
1 CONC early days he was strongly urged to give up the ministry and take up 
1 CONC singing as a career".
1 CONT
1 CONT In the 1890's he lived at 52 Botany Street, Waverley (Sydney). In 1892 he 
1 CONC was the minister at Goulburn.
1 CONT
1 CONT At the Wesleyan Conference in 1900 he led those who wanted a union of the 
1 CONC Methodist churches. At this conference a decision was made to unite in 
1 CONC 1902.  In 1902 a conference was held at which William Woolls Rutledge was 
1 CONC elected the first President of the then new United Methodist Church.

1 CONT JOURNAL AND PROCEEDINGS APRIL 1938 NO. 17, VOL. 6, PART 3
1 CONT
1 CONT THE REV. WILLIAM WOOLLS RUTLEDGE
1 CONT  
1 CONT (Read before the Society by the Rev. F. H. McGowan, General Secretary of 
1 CONC the Australasian Methodist Historical Society, Sydney, and the son-in-law 
1 CONC of the Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge)
1 CONT
1 CONT Biography has an abiding value in literature. The life story of men and 
1 CONC women who have contributed to the well-being of society is inter-woven 
1 CONC with many threads of private and public interest. Frequently it throws an 
1 CONC interpretive light on the age. The reactions of the personally great to 
1 CONC the times in which they lived carry them beyond their own family 
1 CONC associations. They belong to the community, or the country, or in some 
1 CONC cases the world. Their service outlives their own brief span of years.
1 CONT
1 CONT But biography also has a private and personal interest and value in which 
1 CONC ancestry, education and religion largely count. Family history to the 
1 CONC peoples of the East was a thing of vital importance. The family was the 
1 CONC unit. Much depended upon a clear line of pedigree. It was the one title 
1 CONC to certain privileges. Family, tribe, country, religion were linked up 
1 CONC with social practices not known to the alien. While those conditions do 
1 CONC not apply to modern civilisation and community life because of the larger 
1 CONC functions of the State, yet ancestry plays a considerable part in the 
1 CONC life of the average man.
1 CONT
1 CONT The life and work of the Rev. William Woolls Rutledge is worthy of an 
1 CONC honoured place in Australian biography. The available data regarding his 
1 CONC life, though not as full as desired, marks him out as one of the noble 
1 CONC sons of Australian Methodism. He made a generous and rich contribution of 
1 CONC considerable value to the Church and the State. He had a genius for 
1 CONC influencing and moulding public opinion, and stood very high in the 
1 CONC counsels of his Church and the religious life of the State. Few men 
1 CONC laboured so continuously for good causes, or in effort to remove public 
1 CONC evils, and right public wrongs. His influence as a Church leader and 
1 CONC citizen was widely felt. O several occasions he was urged to enter 
1 CONC politics. He was a great man, and would have made his mark in any 
1 CONC calling. He was born in Parramatta, New South Wales, on the 31st of 
1 CONC October, 1849, and died at his residence at Lindfield, Sydney, on the 
1 CONC 19th of May, 1921, in his 72nd year.
1 CONT
1 CONT ANCESTRY
1 CONT
1 CONT Woolls Rutledge was descended from a good family. His ancestry told at 
1 CONC many points in his life and character. His ancestors were of English and 
1 CONC Puritan stock. They gave strong support to the Puritan cause during the 
1 CONC latter part of the year 1500. The dauntless courage and purpose of Woolls 
1 CONC Rutledge in his fight for religious and civil freedom clearly indicated 
1 CONC how strongly in his veins flowed the iron blood of those fearless Puritan 
1 CONC ancestors. Three brothers of the Rutledge family served as officers in 
1 CONC Cromwell�s army, and went with him to Ireland in 1649. They fought the 
1 CONC war against the Irish, and later shared in some of the confiscated 
1 CONC estates in the west of Ireland. They received land in the counties of 
1 CONC Mayo, Sligo, and in one the counties to the north. A descendant of these 
1 CONC rendered distinguished service to the Crown. Honours were conferred upon 
1 CONC him and he was received at the Court of Queen Anne during her reign in 
1 CONC 1702-14. He is described as a man of handsome appearance, and was 
1 CONC playfully spoken of by Queen Anne as her Irish beau. Another descendent 
1 CONC went to America and was one of the signatories to the document of 
1 CONC Independence. About the year 1770, the Sligo branch of the family in 
1 CONC Ireland, from which Woolls Rutledge is descended, removed to the town of 
1 CONC Drumkeerin in the county of Leitrim. Settling there, a son David 
1 CONC Rutledge, in 1805 married the eldest daughter of a Sligo family named 
1 CONC Shannon. His wife�s grandfather was William Shannon, a local preacher in 
1 CONC connection with the first Methodist Society formed in that part of the 
1 CONC country by the preachers sent by Wesley.
1 CONT
1 CONT After fourteen years of married life, David Rutledge�s wife died, leaving 
1 CONC a young family, the youngest not quite twelve years of age. James was 
1 CONC reared by his grandmother Shannon until he was nine, when his father took 
1 CONC him back to his own home. He was converted at the age of nineteen under 
1 CONC the preaching of the Rev. John Nesbit. Some time later he became a class 
1 CONC leader and local preacher. Deeply impressed by the revival services in 
1 CONC connection with the Methodist Centenary in 1839, he thought of entering 
1 CONC the Ministry. With the death of his father, and the loss the family of 
1 CONC certain income, he was forced to change his plans, and decided to try his 
1 CONC fortune in a new land. With a brother and sister, James left Ireland for 
1 CONC Australia on June 8, 1840.
1 CONT
1 CONT THE SCHOOL AT CASTLEREAGH
1 CONT
1 CONT Shortly after his arrival in Sydney, he accepted the position of teacher 
1 CONC of a school at Castlereagh, for which the government had granted a 
1 CONC salary. The first Methodist chapel in the southern world was opened at 
1 CONC Castlereagh on the 7th October, 1817. It was built be John Lees, a 
1 CONC retired soldier, and was given by him to the Wesleyan Mission. James 
1 CONC Rutledge took up his duties in December, 1840. There he remained for 
1 CONC several years as teacher, class leader and local preacher. He married on 
1 CONC June 29, 1842, Miss Lucy Ann, daughter of Mr. Edward Field, who was a 
1 CONC member of the society class. The Rev. F. Lewis was the celebrant.
1 CONT
1 CONT On the recommendation of the Rev. William B. Boyce, he was offered, and 
1 CONC subsequently accepted, the position of teacher at the boys� school at 
1 CONC Parramatta, founded by the Rev. Wm. Woolls, D.Ph.
1 CONT
1 CONT On the 31st October, 1849, Mr. James Rutledge�s fourth child, a son, was 
1 CONC born. He was named William Woolls, at the request of Dr. Woolls, whose 
1 CONC wife and child had both died at about that time.
1 CONT
1 CONT AN EVENTFUL DECADE
1 CONT
1 CONT The decade following his birth was eventful in world affairs. In Great 
1 CONC Britain, the Chartist Riots, the Crimean War, the second Chinese war, and 
1 CONC the Indian Mutiny, focussed public interest and effort. In other 
1 CONC countries were revolutions, the rise of Louis Napoleon in France as 
1 CONC Emperor, and the beginning of the war of Italian Unity. In New South 
1 CONC Wales, after years of agitation, the first parliamentary election under 
1 CONC responsible government was held in 1856. It was a period of progress in 
1 CONC the young country. Woolls Rutledge was born thirty-four years after the 
1 CONC historic arrival of Samuel Leigh as the first Methodist minister in the 
1 CONC continent of Australia. Yet in that short period, Methodism had spread 
1 CONC into all the principal centres of settlement in New South Wales, and also 
1 CONC to the coastal settlements in the north, south, and west of Australia. 
1 CONC The country was in the early stages of development. Tribes of blacks were 
1 CONC numerous. Cattle and sheep stations grew from year to year, pushing 
1 CONC further into the interior. The discovery of gold was a magnet that drew 
1 CONC thousands of men from countries across the seas. Population doubled and 
1 CONC settlement increased beyond all expectations. 
1 CONT
1 CONT THE FAMILY
1 CONT
1 CONT Woolls Rutledge was one of a family of four sons and four daughters. The 
1 CONC eldest brother, Arthur, was admitted to the Queensland bar as a 
1 CONC barrister. He was elected for several years a member of Parliament, and 
1 CONC held the position of Attorney-General. Later, he was appointed judge, and 
1 CONC subsequently was honoured by the King in receiving knighthood. Sir Arthur 
1 CONC Rutledge maintained a life-long devotion to the Church and was one of the 
1 CONC most influential laymen in Queensland Methodism. The second eldest 
1 CONC brother, David, studied at Sydney University, taking his degrees and 
1 CONC graduating in pharmacy and medicine. For some years Dr, David Rutledge 
1 CONC practiced his profession in Sydney, but feeling the call of the Church he 
1 CONC entered the ministry of the Church of England, in which he rendered 
1 CONC distinguished service. The third brother, James, entered commercial life, 
1 CONC and finally made his home in America.
1 CONT
1 CONT William Woolls Rutledge was a man of impressive appearance. He was six 
1 CONC feet in height, with blue eyes, brown wavy hair, and ruddy complexion. 
1 CONC His dignified bearing and distinguished manner marked him out amongst men.
1 CONT
1 CONT As a boy he was strong-limbed, healthy, fond of life and play. His high 
1 CONC daring, initiative, and enterprise, gave him recognised leadership 
1 CONC amongst his school fellows. Clear of mind, active in disposition, he was 
1 CONC everywhere popular. He had a sense of humour and natural art of telling a 
1 CONC story. His sense of right and justice was never in doubt. He formed 
1 CONC strong views on essentials and held to them with great courage and 
1 CONC tenacity of purpose. His readiness to champion the cause of the weak was 
1 CONC an early trait that characterised him in the wider and more serious 
1 CONC spheres of activity. His chivalrous spirit, sympathetic nature, genial 
1 CONC and courteous manner were marked characteristics of his life.
1 CONT
1 CONT EDUCATION
1 CONT
1 CONT The liberal education he received was due to his father, a teacher of 
1 CONC more than ordinary scholastic attainments. His natural gifts and mental 
1 CONC alertness enabled him to acquire knowledge quickly and without much 
1 CONC apparent effort. At an early age he was far advanced in English, Latin, 
1 CONC mathematics, logic and history. Always a reader, and encouraged by his 
1 CONC father to read the best books, he developed a taste for good literature, 
1 CONC especially that of the classics, that laid the foundation of sound 
1 CONC general knowledge. While still in his teens he was widely read in ancient 
1 CONC and modern history, poetry, philosophy, with some slight knowledge of 
1 CONC theology. Gifted with a baritone voice, he was placed the tuition of a 
1 CONC Mr. Hadfield, a teacher of singing. For a short time he took special 
1 CONC lectures at Sydney University. Born and reared in such a home it followed 
1 CONC almost a matter of course, that he became a class leader and local 
1 CONC preacher.
1 CONT
1 CONT FINDING A CAREER
1 CONT
1 CONT His love of reading and writing led him into the field of journalism as a 
1 CONC sphere offering scope for his special gifts. For some years he was 
1 CONC engaged in newspaper work in Sydney. He assisted in the editorship of the 
1 CONC "Harbinger". He was also on the staff of the "Empire", a paper which, in 
1 CONC 1852, was edited by Sir Henry Parkes. It failed in 1858, revived in 1859, 
1 CONC and ran until 1874, when it was incorporated into the "Evening News". 
1 CONC Later, Woolls Rutledge became editor of the "Newcastle Chronicle", from 
1 CONC which he retired to enter the Ministry. His training and experience in 
1 CONC journalistic work had much to do with that clearness and vigour of style 
1 CONC that later enabled him to wield the pen with such power for the Church 
1 CONC and the causes he led. 
1 CONT
1 CONT He devoted most of his leisure time to Church work. Fulfilling preaching 
1 CONC appointments as a local preacher, he attracted favourable notice. 
1 CONC Naturally a fluent speaker, with a full rich voice of rare quality, a 
1 CONC fervid delivery, with the passion of the evangelist, it was not 
1 CONC surprising that people crowded the churches to hear him, and that numbers 
1 CONC professed conversion. He was urged to enter the Ministry, which seemed to 
1 CONC be his proper vocation. For some time he was undecided. He was happy in 
1 CONC his profession. Journalism gave him a wide and independent sphere of 
1 CONC influence and service. Should he forsake the editor�s chair for the 
1 CONC pulpit? After serious thought and prayer he yielded to the inward call 
1 CONC and to the earnest solicitation of friends, and studied for the Ministry. 
1 CONC He was accepted as a candidate in 1875. 
1 CONT
1 CONT CIRCUITS
1 CONT
1 CONT His first appointment in 1875, as a probationary minister, was to the 
1 CONC Orange Circuit, where over a widespread area he made full proof of his 
1 CONC ministry. Then followed his appointment to Newtown with pastoral 
1 CONC oversight of Stanmore. He immediately reached popularity as a preacher. 
1 CONC It was a day of great preachers. The Revs. George Martin, Charles Stead, 
1 CONC J. A. Nolan, George Lane, William Clarke, Dr. Kelynack and others were 
1 CONC then at the zenith of their fame. During his second year at Stanmore, he 
1 CONC married Miss Elizabeth Allen, sister of the Revs. Robert and Harry Allen.
1 CONT
1 CONT At Lithgow, in the Oberon Circuit, he laid deep and broad foundations on 
1 CONC which subsequent Methodism there was built. During his term he was 
1 CONC suddenly bereaved of his wife, who died after a short illness. His next 
1 CONC appointment was to Tamworth, a rising town in the prosperous northern 
1 CONC district. His preaching centres extended to Manilla in the north-east and 
1 CONC to Nundle in the south. His term at Tamworth was one of spiritual power 
1 CONC and revival. During the whole of his pastorate the church was crowded at 
1 CONC the Sunday services, and enlargements to the building were made to 
1 CONC accommodate the increased congregation. His ministry marked the rise of 
1 CONC Tamworth as one of the most important circuits in country Methodism.
1 CONT
1 CONT Mudgee was the next circuit. He married Clara, the second eldest daughter 
1 CONC of the Rev. William Moore, a returned missionary from Fiji, and an 
1 CONC ex-president of the Conference. The Mudgee pastorate brought him into 
1 CONC further prominence. In the pulpit, the press, and on the public platform, 
1 CONC he exercised a far-reaching ministry.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1891 he was appointed to Goulburn, then the largest and wealthiest 
1 CONC city outside Sydney and Newcastle, in New South Wales. In a city of 
1 CONC beautiful churches and cathedrals the Methodist Church was then one of 
1 CONC the best in the country. A substantial congregation regularly met for 
1 CONC worship. In this wide sphere he found full scope for his gifts of 
1 CONC preaching and administration. His influence extended beyond the bounds of 
1 CONC his own church. He was on friendly terms with the heads of various 
1 CONC churches. His unique musical gifts and voice gave him an enlarged sphere 
1 CONC of service. His eloquence and sound evangelical thought attracted large 
1 CONC numbers to his ministry. His congregations ran into several hundreds and, 
1 CONC with the few exceptions of the principal churches in Sydney, were easily 
1 CONC one of the largest in the State. His ministry there is generally regarded 
1 CONC as on of the most powerful in the history of Goulburn Methodism.
1 CONT
1 CONT His appointment to Ashfield was the first of a number of metropolitan 
1 CONC circuits to which he was successively appointed during the remainder of 
1 CONC his active ministry. His outstanding gifts and the connexional value of 
1 CONC his services were generally recognised. At the close of his term at 
1 CONC Ashfield he was appointed to the Superintendency of the Central Methodist 
1 CONC Mission. The founder Rev. W. G. Taylor, was in ill-health through the 
1 CONC heavy strain of the work and was appointed to Bathurst. The effect of the 
1 CONC economic depression in 1893 was still severely felt. The Centenary Hall 
1 CONC was in financial difficulties. Schemes, that it was said would be a 
1 CONC financial success, had turned out badly through the depression. The 
1 CONC C.M.M. was burdened with a crushing debt of over �25 000. The whole 
1 CONC institution needed the most sagacious administration. The thought of the 
1 CONC Conference soon turned to Mr. Rutledge as the most suitable 
1 CONC superintendent for the difficult position. He was appointed, and while 
1 CONC maintaining the high standard of the pulpit, wisely directed the 
1 CONC organisations of the mission, and dealt with the extremely difficult 
1 CONC financial position. He extended the scope of the work. An institute for 
1 CONC inebriates was opened. A medical superintendent and staff successfully 
1 CONC carried on the work of the institute, and large numbers from city and 
1 CONC country were subsequently treated and cured. Another movement instituted 
1 CONC by him was the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon. After a most strenuous term at 
1 CONC the mission he was appointed to Waverley, noted as possessing the most 
1 CONC beautiful Methodist Church in the State. It then had a large membership 
1 CONC and congregation. Mr. Rutledge�s term at Waverley was exceptionally happy 
1 CONC and prosperous.
1 CONT
1 CONT A NOTABLE YEAR AT NEWCASTLE
1 CONT
1 CONT To foster and advance the spirit of church union which he was 
1 CONC successfully directing, he was appointed in 1901 to Newcastle. For one 
1 CONC notable year in addition to the work of his own circuit he did yeoman 
1 CONC service amongst the strong Primitive Methodist Churches and United 
1 CONC Methodists of Newcastle. His brotherly approach, friendliness, and wise 
1 CONC counsel smoothed over some difficult places and undoubtedly hastened the 
1 CONC harmonious consummation of union. During the eventful year in "The 
1 CONC Coalopolis" he initiated the Central Methodist Mission in Newcastle. He 
1 CONC found that the Church was located in a strategically bad position; he 
1 CONC outlined a new and progressive policy; planned for a more central 
1 CONC position, and the establishment of central mission premises. But he was 
1 CONC not left to carry out his plans. The consummation of union in 1902 and 
1 CONC his elevation to the chair as the first President of the United Church 
1 CONC necessitated his residence in Sydney, and he was appointed to Glebe. The 
1 CONC Rev. Rainsford Baven who succeeded him in Newcastle, carried the project 
1 CONC through to successful completion. The presidential year and several 
1 CONC succeeding years were full of important work in connection with the union 
1 CONC and necessary adjustments. His church at Glebe was very well attended 
1 CONC during his term. For three years he was minister at Newtown, and 
1 CONC influential church, and at that time with ta flourishing and growing 
1 CONC membership. His last circuit was historic North Sydney, where he followed 
1 CONC a Godly succession of eminent ministers. The church had fallen on lean 
1 CONC days through the departure of some of the prominent families to new 
1 CONC suburbs opening up along the North Shore line. Mr. Rutledge�s appointment 
1 CONC witnessed a revival of the old days. The church services were well 
1 CONC attended by regular worshippers during the whole of his pastorate.
1 CONT
1 CONT CONSTRUCTIVE WORK
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge had a constructive mind. With a natural aptitude for law he 
1 CONC saw clearly the equities of things. Such was the confidence in his 
1 CONC judgment that he was frequently called upon to act as arbitrator in 
1 CONC matters of dispute. In 1894 he formed the Ministerial Choir to help the 
1 CONC struggling Home Mission demonstration at the annual Conferences. This 
1 CONC meeting, which was the smallest of the public meetings, became the 
1 CONC largest, and its popularity has continued through the years to the 
1 CONC present time. He was conductor of the choir for fourteen years.
1 CONT
1 CONT He secured the passing of new legislation be the Conference of 
1 CONC progressive laws and regulations. Notable amongst these was the 
1 CONC inauguration of the Removal Expenses Fund, which considerable lightened 
1 CONC the burden of circuits in the costs of removal.
1 CONT
1 CONT During his presidential year in 1902, the Australian Protestant Defence 
1 CONC Association was formed. It was largely the work of Rev. W. Woolls 
1 CONC Rutledge, Dr Dill-Mackay, and W. A. Charlston. The constitution framed by 
1 CONC him was accepted practically without alteration. He also did much 
1 CONC preparatory work in the opening of the Dr. Dill-Mackay orphanages.
1 CONT
1 CONT SOCIAL REFORM
1 CONT
1 CONT He took an influential part be letter and personal interview in securing 
1 CONC the passing of the Liquor Reform Bill during the Wade Ministry. The Bill 
1 CONC was framed substantially along the lines he advocated. Following this, 
1 CONC the first local option poll was held on the 10th September, 1907. A 
1 CONC sweeping victory was won, in that reduction was carried 65 electorates, 
1 CONC as against 25 electorates for continuance. This splendid vote was 
1 CONC nullified through the failure to reach a three-fifth majority of the 
1 CONC votes cast. Mr. Rutledge at the time was a Vice-President at the N. S. W. 
1 CONC Alliance and in the forefront of the campaign. The Alliance made him a 
1 CONC life member, "�n recognition of his long and distinguished services to 
1 CONC the cause of temperance". In 1906 he was elected State President of the 
1 CONC N.S.W. Christian Endeavour Union.
1 CONT
1 CONT GREAT CONTROVERSIES
1 CONT
1 CONT He was an able debater. His well-marshalled arguments, his telling voice, 
1 CONC fairness and sincerity, carried considerable weight. When Woolls Rutledge 
1 CONC spoke on some of the big questions of Conference debate, it was certain 
1 CONC that the galleries would be filled with friends or opponents, to hear 
1 CONC him. When first elected to the General Conference he was one of the 
1 CONC youngest members, but his contribution to the business soon won him place 
1 CONC in its highest counsels.
1 CONT
1 CONT Not less powerful was he in newspaper controversy. Ever courteous and 
1 CONC avoiding personalities, he entered into controversy with some of the 
1 CONC ablest controversialists in the State on questions of social and 
1 CONC political reform and other matters of public welfare. Very soon his power 
1 CONC to influence public opinion was recognised. Perhaps his most vigorous 
1 CONC newspaper controversies and victories were regarding insidious attacks on 
1 CONC State education and Government institutions by the Roman Catholic Church. 
1 CONC The movement for political precedence and concessions was led by the able 
1 CONC Cardinal Moran and his not less able lieutenant, Archbishop Kelly. A 
1 CONC policy of aggression and boycott obtained undue privileges. Positions of 
1 CONC place and influence were openly secured for their followers. A strong 
1 CONC attempt was made to undermine the State education system and obtain State 
1 CONC aid for Roman Catholic schools and other industrial institutions. For a 
1 CONC number of years Mr. Rutledge was their most formidable opponent. He 
1 CONC exposed their schemes and the injustice of their claims. The public was 
1 CONC stirred and Protestants awoke to the menace that threatened the public 
1 CONC administration. Matters were brought to a head in the case of a civil 
1 CONC servant (a Protestant) dismissed from the service but appointed to 
1 CONC another important position when he joined the Roman Catholic Church.
1 CONT
1 CONT At a great public meeting in the Sydney Town Hall in 1905, Mr. Rutledge 
1 CONC scathing exposed the sectarian influences at work in the public service 
1 CONC of the State. So great was the publicity given to his speech, that the 
1 CONC Government of the day was forced to take notice. Mr. Rutledge re-affirmed 
1 CONC through the press his public statement. He asked that his statements 
1 CONC should be thoroughly investigated before a proper tribunal. The 
1 CONC Government appointed a select committee of inquiry with Mr. A. Griffith, 
1 CONC M.L.A., as chairman. His appointment as chairman was generally regarded 
1 CONC as most unfair as it was well-known he had a strong prejudice against Mr. 
1 CONC Rutledge. At the opening of the inquiry Mr. Rutledge stated his 
1 CONC willingness to assist the committee in eliciting the truth. He stated 
1 CONC however, his objection to Mr. Griffith as chairman and his principal 
1 CONC judge. Through personal bias he had already made up his mind adversely to 
1 CONC him. The objection was over-ruled by the chairman. The inquiry made a 
1 CONC great stir and aroused much comment. Mr. Rutledge ably conducted his own 
1 CONC case, but was much hampered by the committee. His summing up of the case 
1 CONC was described as one of the most lucid and masterly ever given in any 
1 CONC inquiry in the court of law. The Melbourne "Spectator" in its comment 
1 CONC said: "The summing up by Mr. Rutledge was marked by great ability.....and 
1 CONC must have convinced unprejudiced persons that there was ample ground for 
1 CONC his complaint against Roman methods of packing the public services". The 
1 CONC New South Wales Parliament declined to accept the utterly inadequate 
1 CONC report of the Commission as presented by Mr A. Griffith, the chairman, by 
1 CONC carrying the previous question. The refusal of the N.S.W. Government to 
1 CONC declare there was no foundation for Mr. Rutledge�s complaint, was very 
1 CONC aggressive. Incidentally, the publicity put an end to the preferment that 
1 CONC advanced men-denominationally-out of all proportion to their numbers.
1 CONT
1 CONT Another long controversy was waged with the drink traffic and the 
1 CONC powerful brewery interest which intimidated Governments, and obtained 
1 CONC unwarrantable concessions. The mobilising of the Temperance forces struck 
1 CONC a heavy blow at the liquor ascendancy in the State. Mr. Rutledge�s high 
1 CONC standing in public estimation wan confidence in his proposals. His letter 
1 CONC and reported speeches, found in the old papers of that date, are examples 
1 CONC of discernment, good judgment and high patriotism. They undoubtedly 
1 CONC helped to create and mould public opinion that finally led the Government 
1 CONC to pass the Liquor Reform Bill.
1 CONT
1 CONT CHURCH UNION
1 CONT
1 CONT Great as were his labours in so many spheres, his monumental work was the 
1 CONC union of the several branches of Methodism. He was engaged on this 
1 CONC project for more than ten years. Methodism today little realises the 
1 CONC apparently impossible task of winning over an influential majority at 
1 CONC first opposed to union. His church statesmanship and strong grasp of 
1 CONC details, enabled him to take the hesitating cause in hand. He became the 
1 CONC recognised leader, and directed the movement with ability and 
1 CONC thoroughness. He was perhaps the one man at that stage who could lift the 
1 CONC question from a pious hope to an assured prospect. He crystallised the 
1 CONC union sentiment into practical shape. Constant vigilance hat to be 
1 CONC exercised, however, lest the main purpose should be lost sight of through 
1 CONC parochial fears and differences.
1 CONT
1 CONT How clearly, courteously, patiently and convincingly the leader met the 
1 CONC several objections, is seen in the press correspondence of the day, 
1 CONC reports of committees, Conference debates, and resolutions. "Methodist 
1 CONC Union � A Plain Statement"- was the title of a pamphlet written by Woolls 
1 CONC Rutledge which had wide circulation and a favourable reception. At the 
1 CONC end were "Thirteen Reasons For Methodist Union". They were clear, 
1 CONC reasonable, convincing.
1 CONT
1 CONT Union was still further advanced by a "Grand Union Demonstration" under 
1 CONC the auspices of the Federal Council held in the Centenary Hall, Sydney, 
1 CONC on August 29, 1895. The platform was the most brilliant array of 
1 CONC Methodist speakers ever assemble in Sydney. His Excellency the 
1 CONC Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia, Chief Justice Way, a loyal 
1 CONC Methodist and personal friend of Rutledge, presided. He was accompanied 
1 CONC by Sir Frederick Darley, the Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales. The 
1 CONC speakers were the Hon. J. S. Larke, government representative of Canada; 
1 CONC Rev. W. H. Fitchett, B. A. (Melbourne); Rev. H. T. Burgess (Adelaide), 
1 CONC and Rev. Theophilus Parr, M. A. (Sydney). A choir of 150 voices led the 
1 CONC praise under the conductorship of Mr. W. I. B. Mote, and his son, Arnold, 
1 CONC the brilliant boy organist, the only 14 years of age, presided at the 
1 CONC organ. Mr. T. R. Bavin, B. A., afterwards Premier of New South Wales, 
1 CONC sang a solo.
1 CONT
1 CONT The movement for Union, from that point onwards continued to gain ground 
1 CONC and make headway. At last all conscientious and reasonable objections 
1 CONC were removed. Initial preparations began for organic union. The Methodist 
1 CONC Church Enabling Bill was passed through both Houses of Parliament. It was 
1 CONC resolved that Union would be consummated in the year 1902.
1 CONT
1 CONT FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED CHURCH
1 CONT
1 CONT On Tuesday, February 25, 1902, the first United Conference opened in 
1 CONC Sydney Town Hall. The preparations were largely in the hands of Woolls 
1 CONC Rutledge, and lacked nothing in attention to detail. A united choir of 
1 CONC 250 voices and a well-balanced orchestra led the praise. The hall was 
1 CONC crowded with an audience of over 4,000 people. The President of the 
1 CONC Wesleyan Conference, 1901, Rev. George Lane, presided. The meeting was 
1 CONC pervaded with the spirit of praise and thanksgiving. The long and 
1 CONC difficult negotiations had been brought to a triumphant conclusion. It 
1 CONC was a joyful gathering. The emotion of some found vent in tears as they 
1 CONC sang the old hymn: "And are we yet alive and see each other�s face". The 
1 CONC divided members of the Methodist household were united by the bonds of 
1 CONC Faith, Hope and Love. As was expected, the Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge was 
1 CONC elected President by an overwhelming majority, and was installed as the 
1 CONC press reported, "amid the loud plaudits of the assembly". In 
1 CONC acknowledging the vote, he said that much as he prized the honour of 
1 CONC becoming President, he thanked God more that Methodist union was 
1 CONC accomplished. With him, the cause was always greater than personal 
1 CONC considerations.

1 CONC Henry Kable ?( also known as Keable, Cabell, Cable)? was tried at Norfolk 
1 CONC Lent Assizes and charged with two others, of stealing on the 1st February 
1 CONC 1783 at Aldborough, Suffolk, from the home of Mrs. Abigail Hambling a 
1 CONC quantity of linen, etc � the sentence to be hanged � as the other two 
1 CONC were, -- but Henry then nineteen � was reprieved because of his age and 
1 CONC the sentence altered to fourteen years transportation to the American 
1 CONC colonies.
1 CONT
1 CONT Henry was imprisoned at Norwich Castle gaol in Norfolk. That same year, 
1 CONC Susannah Holmes, also convicted of theft, was incarcerated there. 
1 CONC Although they applied for permission to marry three times, each time the 
1 CONC Governor refused. Eventually Susannah gave birth to a baby boy in the 
1 CONC Castle, to be named Henry like his father and paternal grandfather.
1 CONT
1 CONT In Nov 1786, Susannah and her baby, with a number of other female 
1 CONC prisoners were taken to Plymouth to join the hulks. Some months 
1 CONC afterwards, Susannah, baby Henry with others, were rowed over to the 
1 CONC transport ship 'Charlotte' in the charge of the Turnkey John Simpson. 
1 CONC Captain Thomas Gilbert, the skipper of the Charlotte, angrily refused 
1 CONC permission for the young child to come aboard, saying there were no 
1 CONC papers for him.
1 CONT
1 CONT The good hearted Simpson returne to shore with the baby Henry and hurried 
1 CONC off by coach to London to plead with the Home Secretary, Lord Sydney. 
1 CONC Sydney agreed that the mother and her child should be reunited; he also 
1 CONC arranged for the father to sail with them on the First Fleet.
1 CONT
1 CONT A London newspaper printed the story. A public subscription raised 20 
1 CONC pounds which was used to buy books, clothing and comforts. These gifts 
1 CONC were to be handed over to Susannah on arrival in the colony.
1 CONT
1 CONT While Susannah and her child sailed on the Charlotte, Henry boarded the 
1 CONC ship 'Friendship'. The first fleet sailed into Botany Bay and then into 
1 CONC Port Jackson. On 24 Jan 1788, Henry transferred from the Friendship to 
1 CONC the Supply to take part in the first landing at Sydney Cove.
1 CONT
1 CONT When the couple came forward to claim their gifts it was found that the 
1 CONC clothing and comforts were missing. On 1 Jul 1877, Henry sued the Master 
1 CONC of the Alexander, Captain Duncan Sinclair, for the loss of the goods, in 
1 CONC the first lawsuit to be held in the colony. Henry won his case, receiving 
1 CONC 15 pounds for damages.

1 CONC the West Indian trade and from privateering. Walsh fitted out the vessel 
1 CONC known as the "Doutelle" which carried Charles Edward to Scotland, while 
1 CONC Rutledge fitted out the "Elizabeth" to accompany it. Both vessels also 
1 CONC proved useful after Culloden in bringing back to France many Jacobite

1 CONC The winter of 1788-89 was so cold that people could not work out of 
1 CONC doors. Flour became so scarce that it was rationed, even to those who 
1 CONC could pay. Thomas Jefferson, who lived on Paris at that time records that 
1 CONC invitations to dine, even at the richest houses, included a request for 
1 CONC guests to bring their own bread. On 19th February 1789 James Rutledge 
1 CONC wrote, on behalf of the master bakers of Paris and its suburbs, a 
1 CONC memorandum to King Louis XVI. "M�moire pour la communaut� des ma�tres 
1 CONC boulangers de la ville et faubourgs de Paris", pr�sent� au Roi, le 19 
1 CONC f�vrier, 1789 par James Rutledge
1 CONT
1 CONT Jefferson was asked to notify in America that a premium price would be 
1 CONC paid for flour and, in the months of March, April and May, the French 
1 CONC Atlantic ports alone handled 21,000 barrels of flour. The shortage 
1 CONC continued until July. It was about this time, a few days before the 
1 CONC sacking of the Bastille on 14 July, that Marie Antoinette made her 
1 CONC unfortunate jibe, "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche!", or as we now say she 
1 CONC said, "Let them eat cake!"

1 CONT RUTLEDGE, JOHN JAMES, Soldier, writer, &c. Born at Dunkirk on 5 August 
1 CONC 1742, he was son of Walter Rutledge, a banker and shipowner of that town. 
1 CONC Intending to follow a military career, Rutledge in his youth entered 
1 CONC Berwick's cavalry regiment of the Irish Brigade and took part in the 
1 CONC early campaigns of the Seven Years War. He retired from the army in 1762 
1 CONC and devoted himself to literature and politics. Possessing a perfect 
1 CONC command of the French and English languages, he replied in 1776 to 
1 CONC Voltaire in a work "Observations a I'Acadamie" in which he maintained the 
1 CONC superiority of Shakespeare over French dramatists. During the 
1 CONC Revolutionary period he played a notable part in the social and political 
1 CONC questions of the time. In 1789 he came
1 CONT into much prominence when he attacked Necker, the Minister of Finance, 
1 CONC charging him with a conspiracy to deprive Paris of bread. In connection 
1 CONC with this he was imprisoned for some months. In 1791 he edited a 
1 CONC newspaper in Paris, "Le Creuset," which was notorious for its extreme 
1 CONC sentiments, and later he became edito r"Le Babillard" which published 
1 CONC regularly the speeches of the demagogues in the streets and public 
1 CONC gardens of Paris. At this time he had friendly relations with Marat, who 
1 CONC applauded his denunciations. He was a member of the Cordeliers Club till 
1 CONC his
1 CONT expulsion in November 1791, after which the Jacobin Club refused him 
1 CONC admission on account of his extreme opinions.
1 CONT
1 CONT In October 1793 Rutledge was attacked by Fabre d'Eglantine in the 
1 CONC National Convention and was imprisoned by the "Comit� de S�ret� Generale" 
1 CONC on vague charges. Many regarded him as a fearless champion of the 
1 CONC oppressed and unfortunate and an enemy of venality. His confinement in 
1 CONC prison led to a breakdown of his health, and he died in March 1794. Many 
1 CONC of the vicissitudes of his curious career are told in his "Premier et 
1 CONC second voyage de Milord ... a Paris." A part of this work deals with the 
1 CONC life of Lord Massereene with whom he was a fellow-prisoner for some time.
1 CONT
1 CONT A prolific and versatile writer, the Chevalier Rutledge, as he was 
1 CONC generally known, was the author of many works, among which are: "Thamar: 
1 CONC Trag�die" (1769); "M�moire sur le caract�re et les moeurs des Francais 
1 CONC comip�res � ceux des Anglais" (1776); "La Quinzaine Anglaise" (1776); "Le 
1 CONC Train de Paris ou les Bourgeois du Tours" (1777).
1 CONT
1 CONT The following text (difficult to follow and less reliable but quoted as 
1 CONC is) has been taken from an entry on the Internet:-
1 CONT Jean Jacques Rutlidge (not James) was born August 5, 1742 Dunkerque 
1 CONC (Dunkirk AM) by Walter and Marguerite Lefebvre Rutlidge Dessalhumi�re, a 
1 CONC native of Dunkirk. His father, Dunkirk owner of Irish origin, born in 
1 CONC Saint-Germain-en-Laye (?) French had been nationalized during the 
1 CONC acquisition of land in Champagne; assistance to the Jacobite pretender 
1 CONC Charles Edward Stuart (he armed a ship at his own expense) earned him the 
1 CONC title of baronet in 1745 and, accordingly, R. will that of knight. Walter 
1 CONC Rutlidge married on 1 May 1741 (?), Marguerite Lefebvre, who died around 
1 CONC 1745 and he remarried in 1746 (?) And puts his son to school, he died in 
1 CONC early 1779. R. married about 1769 in Lille, his wife dies at the end of 
1 CONC 1779, they did not, it seems, of descent. Contrary to assumptions Las 
1 CONC Vergnas, Walter (Chapter IV) and Algiers (DNB, 2nd Supp.), R. did not die 
1 CONC in prison during the Terror. Arrested as English 11 October 1793 after 
1 CONC the revolution-against Toulon and sick, it involves Lesueur (3 Brumaire, 
1 CONC AN, F7 47758) and Boucher Saint-Sauveur (23 Brumaire: Statement on an 
1 CONC information, BN, 40,903). In the ads, posters and notices of 16 Germinal 
1 CONC Year II (April 5, 1794, No. 460, p. 6984) for dates of 10 and 11 Germinal 
1 CONC (30-31 March 1794), the obituary says, "James Rutledge , man of letters, 
1 CONC rue Martin. " R. death is free, in its 52nd year. His name is spelled in 
1 CONC official Rutlidge, but there are also Rutledge or Rutlige. Aliases: 
1 CONC Rutofle Lode, KS Wexb, Dr. Stearne, initial: MLCJRGA (Mr. Knight Rutlidge 
1 CONC James, an English gentleman). 
1 CONT
1 CONT Training 
1 CONT The stepmother of R. does not agree with his step-son. At six, in 1748, 
1 CONC he joined as an intern at the Jesuit college of Dunkirk, where he is ten 
1 CONC years without even leaving for the holidays, it is necessary, in 1758, 
1 CONC the superior Rutlidge Walter asks his son to return. Contrary to the 
1 CONC claims of Joseph Pain, censor the Restoration (see Catalog Soleinne, No. 
1 CONC 2131 and 3199), R. therefore knew French very well (see "Letter to Mr. 
1 CONC R.," various works, Yverdon, t. II, p. 203). In 1760 at the age of 
1 CONC eighteen, he entered the cavalry regiment of the Franco-Irish Duke of 
1 CONC Fitz-James, but the unit was disbanded in 1763. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Career 
1 CONT In 1763 he began a journey of "training", went to Lille in Italy (1764), 
1 CONC is back in Lille in 1769. In 1775 he went to Paris to "case". In 
1 CONC June-November 1777, he published in Yverdon, Switzerland. Maybe he made 
1 CONC several trips to London (in 1770, 1776, 1777, 1789?), But according to 
1 CONC the CL., His political essays were published among others "in London, 
1 CONC that is to say, Geneva" (Feb. 1778, Vol XII, p. 63). In 1785-1786, he 
1 CONC published in Lausanne in 1790, in Geneva. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Property status 
1 CONT He lives with his pen and into debt in the hope of property from his 
1 CONC mother where his first trial in 1770. 
1 CONT
1 CONT Opinions 
1 CONT In 1770, he entered into dispute with Walter Rutlidge about the legacy of 
1 CONC his mother. In 1774 to help the father of his wife to carry goods, it is 
1 CONC to the Paris notary D�h�rain, he moved to Paris to pursue the matter 
1 CONC better. It offers some Sartines Turgot then projects the Navy. To get rid 
1 CONC of their bodies and especially to punish political essays in which he 
1 CONC compared the political systems of France and England, the Sartines 
1 CONC arrested April 10, 1777 and release at the end of the month by promising 
1 CONC a mission (Will, May 3, 1777, t. IV, p. 345). In February 1782, the 
1 CONC notary D�h�rain acquires the land of the father-R, who loses his case, to 
1 CONC pay the costs and charged with failure to pay (FV Mulot, Diary, Feb. 8. 
1 CONC 1782; MS, Feb 15. , October 15, 1782). R. is trapped Force September 3, 
1 CONC he was released in February 1783 on the intervention of Espr�mesnil 
1 CONC (letter to R. Espr�mesnil, Feb 10. 1789; response to Espr�mesnil, Feb 11. 
1 CONC in 1789, with Background on the occasion of a quarrel). In June 1778, R., 
1 CONC who thought he was also an economist, had undertaken an information 
1 CONC campaign on the freedom of the bakery (The Bulletin Board, ii). Garin, 
1 CONC the community of bakers, asked a manifesto, and R. present to Parliament,

1 CONC city and the suburbs of Paris (Will, a letter of March 6-8, 1789, t. II, 
1 CONC p. 336: "the book verbiageur Rutlidge Knight, who always tries to be 
1 CONC caustic "). "He sold a lot in spite of the police" (E. Boursin, 
1 CONC Dictionary of the French Revolution, Paris, 1893). Necker, annoyed, 
1 CONC stopped R. November 2, 1789 on charges of "aristocrat monopolist" and is 
1 CONC being held at the Chatelet; Marat does release "lack of evidence" 
1 CONC (Walter, chap. IV, L'Ami du Peuple, 1 July 1790). R. was initiated in 
1 CONC 1776 at the Paris Masonic Lodge "the Irish of the Rising Sun" lodge 
1 CONC founded in 1775 and affiliated with the Grand Orient the same year (A. Le 
1 CONC Bihan, Paris Freemasons of the Grand Orient de France, Paris , 1966; 
1 CONC supplements provided by the Commission of History of the Grand Orient de 
1 CONC France). He is a member in 1790 of the Friends of Human Rights and 
1 CONC contributes to its split in December 1791. Le Creuset, journal lively and 
1 CONC almost entirely written by R., is the body of the club of Cordeliers in

1 CONC DEATH OF MR. GEORGE COWLISHAW.
1 CONT
1 CONT The death of Mr. George Cowlisbaw, ft) long a prominent figure in 
1 CONC commercial and professional circles in Queensland, will cpmo aa a very 
1 CONC great shock to bis large circle of friends in this and the other States. 
1 CONC The deceased gentleman was in his ordinary robust condition of health up 
1 CONC to Tuesday of last week, but after attending the Church of England Old 
1 CONC English Festival at Sandgate that night (New Year's Eve) he complained on 
1 CONC reaching home of feeling unwell. At that time no thought of serious 
1 CONC complications was entertained, but as the days went by the symptoms 
1 CONC became more alarming and they culminated in a seizure of paralysis, from 
1 CONC which Mr. Cowlishaw succumbed at 20 minutes before midnight on Monday 
1 CONC last. The deceased gentleman, who was in his 72nd year, was a member of a 
1 CONC Sydney family, and was trained in the profession of an architect, which 
1 CONC he practised on coming to Queensland some time in the early sixties, he 
1 CONC having offices in Kingsford's Buildings, then the dominant structure in 
1 CONC Queen-street. About 1876 or 1877 the Brisbane "Telegraph" was in a more 
1 CONC or less parlous condition, and was in the market. The Hon. James 
1 CONC Cowlishaw, brother of the deceased gentleman, was one of several 
1 CONC gentlemen who purchased the property, and the deceased subsequently came 
1 CONC into the directorate, and in 1898 succeeded the Hon. F. T. Brentnall as 
1 CONC chairman. Under his control the "Telegraph" prospered and grew. For many 
1 CONC years he had filled the office of managing director, but apart from his 
1 CONC official connection he has exercised a strong personal influence in its 
1 CONC management. That strong personality also manifested itself in all his 
1 CONC business investments, both in the city and elsewhere, and his interests 
1 CONC were both varied and extensive. But though a busy man, immersed in the 
1 CONC care of business, the deceased gentleman was ever ready to listen to the 
1 CONC needs ot those in distress, and though his acts ol charity were always 
1 CONC unostentatiously performed, they were, nevertheless, manifold, and freely 
1 CONC undertaken. His death will come as a greater shock from the fact that so 
1 CONC few knew that he was even ill. The late gentleman is survived by only one 
1 CONC of his brothers, the Hon. James Cowlishaw, M.L.C., and by his two 
1 CONC sisters, Mrs. George Woolnough and Miss Cowlishaw, of Sydney, who, 
1 CONC unhappily, did not arrive in time, so sudden was the end to take a last 
1 CONC farewell of her dying brother. The remains of the late Mr. Cowlinhaw were 
1 CONC interred on Tuesday afternoon in the Toowong cemetery. The passing of a 
1 CONC public man. held in high esteem in the community was marked by the 
1 CONC placing of flags at half mast on the public buildings, and his death was 
1 CONC mourned in many quarters. Despite the fact that the rain fell 
1 CONC persistently, a lengthly cortege of a very representative character 
1 CONC wended its way from Montpelier, Bowen Hills, the residence of the Hon. 
1 CONC James Cowlishaw, M.L.C.. where the body lay, to the place of burial. His 
1 CONC Excellency the Governor was represented, the Lieutenant-Governor was 
1 CONC there in person, as was also the Premier and other men occupying high 
1 CONC official positions. At the house a brief service was conducted by the 
1 CONC Rev. W. S. Bath, who, assisted by the Rev. O. E. Rowe, conducted the 
1 CONC solemn service ait the gravesidee. A profusion of beautiful wreaths 
1 CONC filled three vehicles, those from the members of the family being 
1 CONC conveyed in the private carriage of The Hon. James Cowlishaw. The remains 
1 CONC were interred on an eninence ? in the cemetery overlooking green wooded 
1 CONC hills and near to the tomb of the late Mr. x hallo*, (late Commissioner 
1 CONC for Railways). The chief mourners were Hon. James Cowlisbaw (brother), 
1 CONC Mrs Capper, Mrs. F. W. de Little, and Miss Hilda Cowlishaw (nieces), 
1 CONC Miss. T. O. CowJifliaw, and Masters E. and 0. Capper (grand-nephews). The 
1 CONC pallbearers were Messrs. T. O. Cowlishaw, T. C. Woolnough, J. P. O. 
1 CONC Cowlishaw, G. O. Cowlishas Dr, Eric Cowlishaw (nephews)

1 CONC James Cowlishaw (1834-1929), architect, newspaper proprietor, director 
1 CONC and politician, was born on 19 December 1834 at Sydney, the eldest son of 
1 CONC Thomas Cowlishaw, architect, and his wife Maria, n�e Evans. Educated at 
1 CONC St James's Grammar School, Sydney, he was apprenticed to a chemist but 
1 CONC soon left to become the clerk of a Sydney auctioneer, whose offer of a 
1 CONC partnership he declined. He worked in a scheme to supply Sydney with 
1 CONC water, prospected at the Turon goldfields, joined the Treasurer's 
1 CONC Department in Melbourne and then returned to Sydney to study architecture 
1 CONC under Edmund Blacket.
1 CONT
1 CONT About 1860 Cowlishaw went to Brisbane where he soon found lucrative 
1 CONC outlets for his profession and became involved in the management of 
1 CONC several businesses. He designed a few private homes but was mostly 
1 CONC concerned with building the Commercial Bank of Sydney in Queen Street, 
1 CONC Brisbane, the warehouse for Alexander Stewart & Sons, the Boys' Grammar 
1 CONC School and other large edifices. He acquired a large interest in the 
1 CONC Queensland Trustees Ltd, and was a founder of the Brisbane Gas Co. in 
1 CONC 1864, its first auditor in 1869-73 and then a director, retiring 
1 CONC temporarily in September 1875 to design and superintend the building of 
1 CONC the company's new premises. In succession to Lewis Bernays he was 
1 CONC chairman from March 1879 to 1920. When strikes in 1912 threatened 
1 CONC Brisbane's gas supply Cowlishaw led several deputations to the premier 
1 CONC and his policy helped to avert immediate trouble.
1 CONT
1 CONT Cowlishaw was a director of the Brisbane Courier until Gresley Lukin and 
1 CONC others bought it in 1873. He became managing director of the Brisbane 
1 CONC Telegraph in 1878 and chairman of the Telegraph Newspaper Co. from 
1 CONC December 1879 to May 1885. His brother George was managing director from 
1 CONC 1893 to 1913. James was vice-chairman from November 1917 to August 1920.
1 CONT
1 CONT Cowlishaw was probably best known as a member of the Legislative Council 
1 CONC where he was a nominee in 1878-1922. Although rarely heard in debates he 
1 CONC paid great attention to the drafting of bills and generally reserved his 
1 CONC remarks for the committee stage. In the 1920s he was described as 'the 
1 CONC last of the old Conservative Party'; he was implacably hostile to 
1 CONC Federation, the Labor Party and 'anything that savoured of socialism'.
1 CONT
1 CONT A firm Methodist, he was a practical supporter of his local church for 
1 CONC many years. He gave unobtrusively to charity and was a member of the 
1 CONC Advisory Committee of the Hospital for Sick Children, of which his wife 
1 CONC was president for many years. He was a justice of the peace and sat on 
1 CONC the bench of the Brisbane Police Court. He also helped to start 
1 CONC Brisbane's first cricket club. In his last years he lived at his home, 
1 CONC Montpellier, Bowen Hills, Brisbane, which he had completed to his own

1 CONC Rutledge-Bourne.
1 CONT A very pretty wedding took place in the Church of St. Michael and All 
1 CONC Angels, New Farm, on Thursday week, thus connecting by marriage the 
1 CONC families of two well-known citizens. The bride was Miss Minnie Eleanor 
1 CONC Bourne, second daughter of Mr. R. O. Bourne, Arawatta, New Farm, and the 
1 CONC bridegroom Mr. Ernest Richmond Rutledge, second son of Sir Arthur 
1 CONC Rutledge, K.C. The church had been prettily decorated with white flowers 
1 CONC and choice foliage, the pretty wedding bell being the handiwork of the 
1 CONC bride's sister, Miss Elsie Bourne, and the other decoration being carried 
1 CONC out by the girl friends of the bride. The Rev. Walter Thompson 
1 CONC officiated, and Miss Hendry presided at the organ. The bride, who was 
1 CONC given away by her father, wore an eminently becoming gown of ivory-white 
1 CONC Japanese silk, the full skirt having a demi-train ornamented with 
1 CONC kiltings of silk; pretty cross-over bodice with deep berthe of Honiton 
1 CONC point lace, and yoke of tucked point-de-gaze net; full elbow sleeves with 
1 CONC deep cuffs of Honiton point lace. She wore a wreath of orange blossom and 
1 CONC a tulle veil, and also a beautiful pearl and turquoise necklet and 
1 CONC pendant, the gift of the bridegroom, as was also her lovely shower 
1 CONC bouquet, composed of narcissus, roses, white sweetpea, camellias, and 
1 CONC choice ferns, tied with long streamers of white satin ribbon. The bride's 
1 CONC gift to the bridegroom was a set of gold sleeve links. She was attended 
1 CONC by two bridesmaids, the Misses Elsie Bourne (sister), and Ivy Rutledge of 
1 CONC the bridegroom). Both wore dainty frocks of white coating serge, opening 
1 CONC over vests of lace; white saucer hats with crowns formed of violets. 
1 CONC Their gold bangles and lovely- bouquets (of white roses, narcissus, 
1 CONC violets, and mauve asters, tied with pale-mauve ribbons) were the gifts 
1 CONC of the bridegroom. Mr. Leslie South and Mr. Reginald Palmer acted as 
1 CONC groomsmen. The church was crowded with the invited guests, and the many 
1 CONC friends of both families, who showered rose leaves over the newly-married 
1 CONC couple as they left the building. After the ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Robert 
1 CONC Bourne held a reception at their residence, Arawatta, New Farm, where 
1 CONC many congratulations and good wishes were offered to the young couple. 
1 CONC Afternoon tea was served in the dining-room, the handsome two-tier bride 
1 CONC cake being prettily, decorated with silver leaves, silver cachous, sprays 
1 CONC of orange blossom, lucky slippers, and streamers of white ribbon. In the 
1 CONC afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Rutledge left for Toowoomba, where they 
1 CONC intend spending the honeymoon. The bride's travelling dress was of gray 
1 CONC and brown checked tweed, the skirt tucked at the hips, and ornamented 
1 CONC with strappings in a round design; Russian cross-over bodice, with vest 
1 CONC of cream gui pure and pipings of brown silk, with touches of pale blue; 
1 CONC hat of violet crinoline, trimmed with black velvet, and lined (with

1 CONT Continuation of the Notes in the main scrapbook about Woollls Rutledge
1 CONT
1 CONT TRIBUTE BY THE PRESS
1 CONT
1 CONT The daily papers the next morning made lengthy and generous reference to 
1 CONC the Conference and its President. The Sydney "Daily Telegraph" in a 
1 CONC eulogistic account of the President�s successful career said: "When the 
1 CONC movement for Methodist union was first started, he consistently 
1 CONC championed the cause during the years when the question of Union was not 
1 CONC altogether favourable. It was largely due to his effort as the recognised 
1 CONC leader of the Inions Party that the consummation of the great scheme was 
1 CONC brought about. His elevation to the dignified and honourable position of 
1 CONC first President of the Conference of United Methodism was a tribute to, 
1 CONC and a reward for, the services he had rendered to the cause". His 
1 CONC election was received with satisfaction by the Church and State. His 
1 CONC personal popularity with all sections of the uniting Churches enable them 
1 CONC to see in him in that year of transition, the spirit and embodiment of 
1 CONC Union.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Hon. Wm. Robson, M. L. C., an honoured Methodist layman, wrote in the 
1 CONC Church paper "The Methodist": "The subject of his sketch is a notable 
1 CONC figure in the Methodist Church of Australasia. He has a high reputation 
1 CONC in the Methodism of the continent as represented by the General 
1 CONC Conference. The special work to which Mr. Rutledge has devoted his 
1 CONC abilities and energies during the past dozen years is that of bringing 
1 CONC about the union of the several Methodist Churches. From the first he was 
1 CONC the natural and acknowledged leader. Fearless in fight he was always 
1 CONC shown himself fair and considerate to opponents.....now he has the reward 
1 CONC and joy of seeing union not only in New South Wales but throughout 
1 CONC Australasia".
1 CONT
1 CONT At he time of his election he was the youngest President to occupy the 
1 CONC chair. It was a coincidence, as one of the Sydney papers pointed out in 
1 CONC its leader, that a year, to a day, after the inauguration of the 
1 CONC Commonwealth, came the federation of Australian Methodism.
1 CONT
1 CONT During his presidential year he was fully engaged in the work of 
1 CONC adjustment and in strengthening the bonds of the united Church.
1 CONT
1 CONT CENTENARY FUND
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge�s last great work was in connection with the Centenary Fund. 
1 CONC Conference proposed that the first hundred years of Methodism in 
1 CONC Australia should be worthily celebrated in 1915, and marked by suitable 
1 CONC memorials. The chief need was the establishment of a college for the 
1 CONC training of students for the ministry. Opinion was divided as to whether 
1 CONC there should be one college affiliated with the University to serve for 
1 CONC students entering the ministry or the profession, or a separate college 
1 CONC for theological students. Round the question, debate ranged for some 
1 CONC time. Woolls Rutledge advocated the affiliated college as the first step, 
1 CONC and to this the Conference agreed. It was further proposed and agreed to, 
1 CONC that a theological college also be established. It was left to 
1 CONC subscribers to allocate their donations in any proportion they chose. 
1 CONC These two education institutions were to be the main objects, although it 
1 CONC was optional for subscribers to give to the existing colleges at 
1 CONC Newington and Burwood, or for Home and Foreign Missions. Five years were 
1 CONC to be taken in preparation, and an effort made to raise �50,000. With 
1 CONC great faith and courage the Church in New South Wales set itself this 
1 CONC tremendous task.
1 CONT
1 CONT The opinion was freely expressed that the Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge was the 
1 CONC man most capable of successfully organising the fund. It was believed 
1 CONC that his appeal would stir the loyalty and generosity of Methodists 
1 CONC throughout the State. He was elected organising secretary. Seven years 
1 CONC previously he had brought together the Methodist Churches in union, and 
1 CONC now he was commissioned to ask the united Church for the large sum of 
1 CONC �50,000. If he had consulted his own feelings he would have declined. 
1 CONC Money raising was not to his liking. But it was characteristic of him 
1 CONC that he never refused to obey the call of the Church however great the 
1 CONC task. He was elected by the 1909 Conference, and began preparations for 
1 CONC launching the appeal the following year.
1 CONT
1 CONT During the 1910 Conference, the enterprise was opened with a monster 
1 CONC tea-meeting in the basement of Sydney Town Hall, followed by a large 
1 CONC meeting in the Lyceum Hall. The massed audience generously responded to 
1 CONC the inaugural appeal. Money and promises poured in till the largest sum 
1 CONC ever received at any Methodist gathering in Sydney, amounting to several 
1 CONC thousands of pounds was received.
1 CONT
1 CONT VISITATION OF THE CIRCUITS
1 CONT
1 CONT The visitation of the circuits was a wearying itinerary. The strain of 
1 CONC nightly meetings and Sunday services was extremely exacting. Frequently 
1 CONC he preached three times on Sunday, lectured each night of the week, and 
1 CONC interviewed people by day. His rest was broken by the necessity of 
1 CONC catching night trains, or trains in the very early morning. From circuit 
1 CONC to circuit he went by train, steamer, coach or other conveyance. The 
1 CONC motor car, in 1910, was not in such general use as it is today and much 
1 CONC of his travel in the country was by sulky and buggy. Some of the journeys 
1 CONC were over rough roads and bush tracks. He was out in all kinds of 
1 CONC weather. In addition he was asked at times to open Churches and 
1 CONC Parsonages. He gave himself unreservedly to the work. So strenuous were 
1 CONC his labours that they began to tell on his vigorous frame. Towards the 
1 CONC end of his third year in the field when he had secured cash and promises 
1 CONC nearly �40,000, he suddenly had a serious breakdown in health. He was 
1 CONC taken to the Maitland Parsonage. His wife and a Sydney specialist 
1 CONC hastened to his side. For some time his life hung in the balance. The 
1 CONC whole Church gave itself to prayer for his recovery. Slowly the crisis 
1 CONC passed and he regained comparative health. He was most desirous of 
1 CONC completing the objective of the Fund, despite the advice of his family 
1 CONC and his friends, he continued the work.
1 CONT
1 CONT Eight months later, in August, 1914, the great war loomed upon the world 
1 CONC with unexpected suddenness and fury. The war loomed so largely in the 
1 CONC national life, that everything, including the Centenary Fund, was 
1 CONC overshadowed by the cloud of anxiety. This increased the difficulty of 
1 CONC his task. His own home was, as many others, was immediately concerned. 
1 CONC Three of his sons enlisted, and two of them fought in Gallipoli and 
1 CONC France throughout the whole period of the war.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Centenary celebrations were held successfully in August, 1915. There 
1 CONC is no doubt that but for the war the Centenary Fund would have been 
1 CONC oversubscribed. Mr. Rutledge continued for another year finalising the 
1 CONC work. His doctors, however, were strongly averse from his taking up any 
1 CONC further work. He retired into supernumeraryship at the Conference of 
1 CONC 1916, a remarkable tribute being paid to him and his ministry "which has 
1 CONC been marked by distinguished ability both in the pulpit and in the 
1 CONC administration of the affairs of the Church".
1 CONT
1 CONT CENTENARY MEMORIALS
1 CONT
1 CONT The outstanding memorials of the Centenary Fund are Leigh College for 
1 CONC theological students, and Wesley College affiliated with the University 
1 CONC of Sydney. Leigh College is valued at �35,000; and Wesley College was 
1 CONC built at a cost of �20,000. These two colleges will ever be associated 
1 CONC with the name of the Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge, as monuments of his last 
1 CONC great work in raising money for their establishment. In recognition of 
1 CONC his devoted and successful labour, he was elected first honorary Master 
1 CONC of Wesley College.
1 CONT
1 CONT HIS RECREATIONS
1 CONT
1 CONT Though capable of concentration and sustained effort he could relax 
1 CONC easily. His sports consisted of cricket in his younger days, in which he 
1 CONC was a good batsman, and in later years he enjoyed a game of tennis. His 
1 CONC two favourite hobbies were his fern house, the ferns, and carpentering. 
1 CONC These became his chief recreation. If his health had been more 
1 CONC satisfactory it was his intention to enter upon a world tour. He loved 
1 CONC children and young people and they delighted to have him join in their 
1 CONC games and mirth. He enjoyed good literature and was a wide reader. His 
1 CONC large and costly library contained many of the choicest books. But no 
1 CONC general reading book ever took the place of the Bible, of which he was a 
1 CONC devout student and an expert expositor. He held to the Methodist 
1 CONC standards of doctrine. His preaching was based on sound evangelical 
1 CONC theology. His retiring presidential address and his ordination charge 
1 CONC reached a high standard of excellence and of spiritual insight and 
1 CONC appeal. 
1 CONT
1 CONT CONNEXIONAL HONOURS
1 CONT
1 CONT He occupied the foremost positions in the Conference, and was the 
1 CONC recipient of many honours. He held military and civil chaplaincies. On 
1 CONC various occasions he was acting editor of "The Methodist". It was 
1 CONC generally thought by his friends that he would be elected President of 
1 CONC the General Conference, but failing health deprived him of this crowing 
1 CONC honour. Aristocratic in tastes and feelings, he mixed freely with the 
1 CONC educated, and moved in the best circles. He was on close and intimate 
1 CONC terms with public leaders and with men holding some of the most 
1 CONC influential positions. His sympathies, however, were ever with the less 
1 CONC fortunately situated in life. He was their friend to whom they never came 
1 CONC in vain for counsel and help.
1 CONT
1 CONT He was a man of unfailing courtesy, considerate of the rights and feeling 
1 CONC of others, even in things of apparently small moment. Perfectly frank, he 
1 CONC was free from any personal animus, though fighting strongly for 
1 CONC principles. In a final letter in a paper in which he had been engaged in 
1 CONC controversy, he wrote: "I have attacked no man�s religion. I hold that a 
1 CONC man�s religious belief, so far as it affects only himself and his Master, 
1 CONC is a matter too sacred for public discussion. I have not descended to 
1 CONC personal abuse of my opponents; but have attacked principles". It was his 
1 CONC freedom from unworthy feelings regarding opponents, that led them to 
1 CONC respect him as they did.
1 CONT
1 CONT He maintained, through all the turmoil of his life, a deeply spiritual 
1 CONC experience. Never was he too busy or too weary for a private prayer or 
1 CONC devotion. This pervaded his life, and was immediately felt by those 
1 CONC brought into personal contact with him. The same spiritual influence was 
1 CONC felt in his Church services and meetings.
1 CONT
1 CONT AT HOME
1 CONT
1 CONT The choicest gold of his life was shared by his family and home. Here he 
1 CONC was seen at his best. He had six sons and one daughter. His strong 
1 CONC affectionate nature found its rest and satisfaction in the love and joy 
1 CONC of his wife and children. He was ever considerate and appreciative. The 
1 CONC strength and love of his life was poured forth to those whom God had 
1 CONC given him in his family. His was the ideal home in simplicity, truth and 
1 CONC love. While there was no favouritism in the home, yet he was strongly 
1 CONC attached to his only daughter. On the occasion of her marriage to the 
1 CONC Rev. F. H. McGowan, he said he rejoiced in her happiness, while at the 
1 CONC same time they would miss her as the light of the home.
1 CONT
1 CONT LAST DAYS
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge attended his last Conference in 1921, and took his 
1 CONC accustomed seat on the platform at the opening session. He also took part 
1 CONC in the Conference business, although his health was far from 
1 CONC satisfactory. About the middle of May, he suffered a collapse, and was 
1 CONC ordered by his Doctor to keep to his bed for quietness and rest. The 
1 CONC spirit was still strong, but he body was worn out in the service of his 
1 CONC God, Church and country. On the 19th May, 1921, he passed to higher 
1 CONC service. Hundreds of telegrams and letters of sympathy and appreciation, 
1 CONC poured in to the bereaved widow and family. The regret and eulogy of the 
1 CONC city and country press were spontaneous and general. The main features of 
1 CONC his life and work were recalled and printed in generous appreciation. His 
1 CONC passing was received by the people of Methodism with profound sorrow. It 
1 CONC was a tribute to his standing in the community, that his funeral was 
1 CONC attended by representatives of all the Churches, members of the State 
1 CONC Parliament and Legislative Council, the City Council, business and 
1 CONC professional men, and a large number of friends in the rank and file of 
1 CONC the Church and State. The address in the Lindfield Church was given by an 
1 CONC old friend, Rev. E. J. Rodd, principal of the Methodist Ladies� College. 
1 CONC The President and Secretary of the Conference and others took part at the 
1 CONC Church and the graveside. All that was mortal of this great soul was laid 
1 CONC to rest in the Rookwood cemetery, on the 21st May, 1921.
1 CONT
1 CONT This biographical sketch may be appropriately closed with a tribute by 
1 CONC the late Rev. Dr. J. E. Carruthers in his book , "Memoirs of an 
1 CONC Australian Ministry". He describes it as a wreath laid upon the grave of 
1 CONC a trusty and well-beloved friend. "William Woolls Rutledge was one of the 
1 CONC choicest souls that God had called of recent years into the ministry of 
1 CONC the Methodist Church. His abilities were above the average, and his range 
1 CONC unusually comprehensive. He was an evangelist, and had wonderful success 
1 CONC in soul-winning in Newtown, Lithgow, Tamworth and other places in his 
1 CONC early ministry; he was an organiser and administrator......he was skilled 
1 CONC in Conference debate and was foremost for many years in its discussions; 
1 CONC he was an effective platform speaker.....for social reform propaganda, 
1 CONC for Protestant defence and aggression, and for connexional and patriotic 
1 CONC purposes. He was of the order of ecclesiastical statesman, as was shown 
1 CONC by his successful piloting of the Methodist Union Movement in New South 
1 CONC Wales. The last service he rendered was in connection with the Centenary 
1 CONC Thanksgiving Fund in 1910-15, the outstanding memorials of which are 
1 CONC Wesley College and Leigh College. But above all, the personal qualities 
1 CONC of W. W. Rutledge were those in which his true greatness lay. Chivalrous 
1 CONC to an unusual degree, charitable ever in his judgements, constant with 
1 CONC the constancy of steel to his friendships, devout in his spirit, 
1 CONC beautifully submissive in affliction and suffering, and supremely loyal 
1 CONC to the Lord and Saviour of us all, W. W. Rutledge was one of whom it may 
1 CONC truly be said that being dead he yet speaketh".

1 CONT Saturday 5 May 1906 RUTLEDGE THE DISTURBER.
1 CONT
1 CONT The Rev. W. Rutledge is again in evidence ns a disturbing clement. 
1 CONC Recently the Temperance Alliance had an election of office bearers, and 
1 CONC the Rev. Mi-. Boyce attonded a meeting for the purpose of announcing the 
1 CONC result arid making a consequent declaration. Mr Rutledge was also there, 
1 CONC and he asserted that tho election was not valid. There had boen 
1 CONC Irregularities, he said ; also underground engineering. Certain explana 
1 CONC tions that were made he described con temptuously as white-washing. 
1 CONC Altogether the proceedings were lively. A woman of ficer became very 
1 CONC angry, and put, through the chairman, some questions in a freezing manner 
1 CONC to a person who was siding with Mr. Rutledge. Finally, Mr. Boyce declared 
1 CONC the election invalid, because sufficient notice of it had not boon given. 
1 CONC The Licensed Victuallers' Association will make merry over this episode. ,

1 CONC WOOLLS RUTLEDGE CASE
1 CONT
1 CONT SYDNEY, Wednesday. The Parliamentary Select Committee took further 
1 CONC evldonco today in connection with the Woods Rutledge charges, respecting 
1 CONC the influence of religion ni connection,with tho Public Service.
1 CONT
1 CONT Mr Rutledge asked whether protection would extend to persons whose names 
1 CONC were mentioned by witnesses. The Chairman� replied that such protection 
1 CONC would not be necessary. Anything that Mr. Rutledgo might say that another 
1 CONC person had said would not be evidence against that person. Mr. Rutledge, 
1 CONC "With reference to my statement that, on the night the committee was 
1 CONC appointed that l heard you say, 'Now wo will get these slanderers', 
1 CONC you-designated that a Ile, and an invented Ile, I now. ask to be 
1 CONC permitted to read to the committee, a communication I have received". The 
1 CONC Chairman, "You made a statement in tho press, and I said it was not true. 
1 CONC You cannot give evidence of it here". 
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge, "1 maintain that I am entitled to make a statement. I 
1 CONC should be able to read this letter". 
1 CONT The Chairman stated that he had said what Mr. Rutledge had said was not 
1 CONC correct.
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge replied that it appeared on the records of the committee 
1 CONC that the Chairman had said that a statement made by him (Mr. Rutledge) 
1 CONC was "an invented lie." 
1 CONT The Chairman admitted that he said so, but declined to be browbeaten by 
1 CONC Mr. Rutledge. 
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge, "It is not browbeating, 
1 CONT The Chairman, "If you brought 10 letters they would not be evidence.
1 CONT Mr. Rutledge asked the Chairman if he still declined to admit the letter, 
1 CONC and the Chairman replying in the alllrmatlve, Mr. Rutledge said ho would 
1 CONC have to full back on his only means of making it public, a free press.
1 CONT
1 CONT G. A. Wilson. Chairman of the Public Service Board, said ho had no 
1 CONC hesitation in declaring Hall quite competent to fill the position lie now 
1 CONC occupied as Government Statistician, and that the Board absolutely knew 
1 CONC nothing about Hall's religion.
1 CONT
1 CONT SYDNEY, Friday
1 CONT The sittings were re- sumed yesterday. Mr. A. II. Griffith, M.P. was 
1 CONC chairman. Mr. Wilson, Chairman of the Public Service Board, said there 
1 CONC were no means of ascertaining the religions of candidates for the 
1 CONC service. Mr. Hall made a statement to the effect that religion had 
1 CONC nothing to do with his appointment.
1 CONT
1 CONT Rev. Woolls Rutlcdgo recounted the state ments made to him, and said that 
1 CONC a Departmental Inquiry had previously boen held regarding sectarianism. 
1 CONC Somo strong remarks were mnde by Mr. H. Donaldson, M.P. during the procee 
1 CONC ings. Ho accused Mr, Rutledgo of showing bitter brutal bigotry, but 
1 CONC afterwards withdrew the statement. Close

1 CONC Rutledge (cousin of the bridegroom). Miss Knight and Miss Finney wore 
1 CONC heliotrope, and the other young ladies wore white. Much interest was felt 
1 CONC in the event, as the bride is a great favourite with her former 
1 CONC schoolfellows and in society gene rally, and many regrets were expressed 
1 CONC that owing to her future home being in the sister colony Brisbane friends 
1 CONC cannot hope to see so much of Mrs. Oakes in the future as they would 
1 CONC wish.
